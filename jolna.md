# Jolna

Welcome to the world of Jolna! Jolna is a world of Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Magic, Gods, Angels, Demons, Ents, Monsters, and Dragons. That is to say, it's on the surface like any other fantasy world. However, where it lacks surface level novelty, it makes up for in detail and uniqueness. Sure, you've seen orcs before, but have you seen orcs as honorable mercenaries who will fight in any war they're paid for? And sure, you've seen elves before, but have you seen elves with paper white skin which they paint using magic to show their individuality? Each one of the things I've mentioned, and more, have details with that level of thought put into them.

I will be writing short stories set in this world about every month, and potentially other stuff if I feel like it.
