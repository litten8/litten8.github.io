The 30th day of the Year 91 After Arrival

Today is finally the day! The day I will go on my first voyage! The day I've been preparing for, well, for all my life really! Well, assuming there are no further delays. It was technically supposed to be 8 days ago, but there was a storm off the coast which would have made travel dangerous.

I'm almost afraid to look outside, in fear of cloudy skies. So, instead, I look around my tent. I'm sitting on the bundle of cloth that makes up my bed right now. I should really neaten that up before I leave. In the corner of the tent there's a large wooden box containing bits of meat and berries left over from my winter stockpile. It's spring now, so no need to worry about that. Near that box is the spear I use for hunting reindeer, as well as bundles of clothes. I would need to get some of those on, but winter only just ended, so I'm used to sleeping in my clothes. Though, a change wouldn't be a bad idea.

I get up, and I take off my clothes. I then go through the pile of cloth, and grab a few thick pieces of hide to tie around my waist. I decide to be fancy, and use my magic to create a teal circle near the top of it. While it isn't exactly warm enough to go topless yet, at least not as far north as the Elven Lands, I decide that rather than bundling up my entire body in more pieces of fur, I'll just get a couple small pieces of cloth and bundle up my neck and upper chest, leaving my stomach bare. Since I'm using small pieces of cloth, I spice things up by grabbing an orange fox pelt as one of the two cloths I tie up for my top.

Next I look to my mirror. It's by far the most valuable thing I own, even though it's barely bigger than my hand. Silver has to be imported from the Dwarven Lands, a place filled with warlords and monsters. Supposedly this mirror was brought by a Giant who, after years of war, decided to settle down in the Elven lands, where he ended up having children, and is actually my Great-Grandfather. This story is possible, I guess, but I find it unlikely. Chances are, one of my ancestors just traded a bunch of bread to nearby dwarves for it. Bread is nutritious food that isn't meat, something not easy to find in the Dwarven Lands.

Anyways, I grab the stick I've been using as a wand, and begin using it to levitate the mirror. While it's possible to levitate stuff without a wand, having a way to aim is quite helpful, even for experts like me. I turn the mirror around so I get a complete view of myself, and I look like a sailor! I do notice one thing though, the marks on my face are pictures of boats. I made them like that to demonstrate my desire to go on a voyage, but today, I will be one of many on a boat who had that same dream. So, I need to change that up. I wave my hand over my face to dismiss the magic. Well, since my occupation on the ship will be as the ship mage, maybe something related to magic? Maybe some fancy lines that look like the casting of an intricate spell? Nah, that's too complex. I just wave my hand over my face, and in bright cyan write the word Ë¦ðŸœ•â€™IIðŸœ• *kÃ¡tta*, which means magic. Also, while I'm at it, I untangle all the knots in my hair in the same wave of my hand.

I'm almost ready to go. There is one more thing I need though. Most of the food we'll be eating on the voyage will be fish we get from the water we sail through, but eating only fish isn't very good for you. That's why every elven sailor is required to bring a bundle of bread and berries aboard the voyage. So, I grab some berries from the box of food, bundle them up, and... Oh, I'm out of bread.

Well, no worries! I just need to stop by the market on the way to the docks. I grab the bundle of berries, and head outside. The day is clear, as I had hoped, meaning the voyage will happen. That is, if I make it on time. I should hurry on my way to the market so I'm not late.

My tent is pretty far from the other tents, which are deeper in the forest. Once I decided to move out of my parents' place, I decided to set up my tent closer to the docks. That decision nearly a decade ago means that I should have enough time to go to the market to get some bread! And I really do need to bring bread, since it's unlikely I'd be let on the voyage if I didn't bring any.

I begin running North toward the market, trying to avoid any piles of snow or puddles which could drench my boots, as well as staying clear of the occasional tree. I point my wand toward the market, summoning a slight wind to help me run faster. Eventually, I see the wooden stands of the market.

"Hey Nuppu!" I hear a voice yell. Specifically, the voice of Nukkala, the local farmer who sells bread, berries, meat, and hides with her husband Puliu. She's also famous for gossiping, which is probably how she knew today was the day. As I come closer, I see her turn to her husband, who's standing right next to her behind the stand. "Remember I bet you five shells that he'd need to buy something before his voyage?"

"No, not really." Comes Puliu's tired reply.

"Well pay up!" She says, holding out her hand.

"Hey, he could be here to say goodbye to us or something," he responds, "I don't need to pay up yet."

Once I catch my breath from the running I'd been doing, I speak up. "Actually, I am here to buy something."

"Ooh, what is it?" Nukkala asks. "Need some new clothes? Got hungry? Did you forget -"

"Yeah, I forgot to get some bread. I was lucky enough to have some berries leftover from last autumn though."

"I see you don't have any shells... Don't intend to pay?"

"How about you give me a couple of loafs in exchange for a favor?"

"Hah! We both know that favor will be useless. After today, we won't see you again for at least two years!"

"Hah, I know. I was actually hoping I could do some magic for you. I don't exactly have many shells." That was technically not true. I don't actually have any shells.

"So you said you wanted two loafs? I guess that'll be *fine*." She didn't seem happy with my offer, but it wasn't like I had any other option.

"How about an object that'll warn you of any pests trying to take any of your rye?"

"Huh, that's surprisingly useful. Any caveats?"

"Well, you'll need to mark out the area it'll track, and renew it about every two weeks."

"Sounds like it's worth about the same as two loafs. Deal."

"Nice. Gimme a minute to to make it." I look on the ground for a pointy rock, which would be ideal for the object I want to make. There are some that are close to the right shape, but none are perfect. I pick a few up and compare them, and pick one that's pretty smooth, but the point isn't very pointy. I decide to mark the end I imagine to be the point with some cyan coloring to make it clearer.

Now, I tap the rock on the ground once, making note of the position. I then look away, and focus on my lack of knowledge of whether they are pests and focus that curiosity into the rock. Then, I add a small cyan dot on the side of the rock tied to that, so that it will glow brightly if there are pests. I then tap the same spot I tapped earlier to unmark it, and hand the rock over to Nukkala.

I begin explaining its function to her. "Tap a spot on the ground with the end to mark an area to scan for pests, and you can tap the same spot again to unmark it. Also, after about two weeks, it'll probably unmark a spot by itself, so you'll need to tap it again. Got it?"

"Yeah. You sure it'll work?" She asks, cautiously

"Well, I wouldn't be hired as a ship mage if I was bad at magic. That is to say, yeah, I'm as sure it'll work as I'm sure I'll survive my voyage."

"Right. Take your bread." She says. Her husband hands two loafs of bread over to me. I put the bread in the bundle with the berries.

I begin walking away, while still facing them. "Bye! Thanks for the bread!" After I see them wave at me, I turn around and cast another wind spell to get moving Southeast toward the docks.
