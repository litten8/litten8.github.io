# Outer Wilds

Outer Wilds is an amazing game. It is an open world space exploration game, with many unique mechanics. While I could discuss these mechanics, they aren't what makes the game special. What makes it special is the way you slowly discover the story of the game. Theoretically this could have been done without the many special mechanics, but the mechanics help add to the discovery, and bring this game from merely special to truly amazing. While there are many games focusing on slowly learning about a world, I am pretty sure none do it like Outer Wilds. In most games focused on learning, there are two ways to go about teaching about the world. One is to have an abstract puzzle represent discovering things, and when you complete the puzzle there will be some exposition, or there will be some kind of normal video game challenge, and when you finish it, you will find a book or another character to give you exposition. That isn't how it works in Outer Wilds. In Outer Wilds, each piece of information is only a couple sentences long, and isn't very hard to find. Maybe you'll find some text inscribed on a wall mentioning an experiment on the south pole of a planet, or a character will tell you about a path to an ancient city starting from the equator. You will find tons of these scattered throughout the game, many of which are available easily from the start. So you have a choice of which lead to follow. Conveniently, the log on the ship you're on has a list of all the information you gather, so you don't need to constantly waste time going back to remember stuff if you don't take notes. This means you can just turn around and check if you're getting stuck on one path, because there will be a bunch others for you to follow. So let's say you want to find the path from the equator to the city, but keep falling into holes and dying or getting stuck on the way, so you don't want to work on it any more. Never fear, as you can change your mind and head to that south pole you heard about, and see what's going on there! Now, the best part is, if you follow each of the hints to their end, you can find another piece of information, leading you somewhere else! This goes down a couple layers before you reach hints about beating the game, which is technically possible without following any of the hints, but you just need to find out by reading the hints! This is another way it stands apart from other games involving discovery, in that the discovery directly leads to the end of the game!

Now, I haven't even talked about the other thing that sets Outer Wilds apart from not just other discovery games, but almost all other games in general! The dynamic world. Now, while many games have worlds that can change in minor ways as a result of the player's actions, but in Outer Wilds, the world changes by itself. For example, there is a planet that slowly falls apart over twenty minutes, preventing certain paths from being followed, but also causing certain roadblocks to fall apart. Now, this might seem like a bad idea, preventing players from accessing the things that dissolve early if they don't discover them until later into the game, but this is solved by the last unique mechanic. The time loop. Outer Wilds runs on a time loop, where every twenty minutes, the entire world resets, and you wake up back on the starting planet, with only your knowledge intact. This means that if you find a place, but it's destroyed by the passage of time, you just wait until the world resets, and try to get there as fast as possible. This is probably the least interesting of the features in Outer Wilds, but it really brings everything together, making learning about the world the only thing that matters to progress in the game.

# Celeste

Celeste is the only platformer I've ever beat. And it's an incredibly good one at that, as well as being very unique. The thing that sets it apart from other platformers the most is the level size. I will be defining level as the area between two points which you can restart indefinitely. In most platformers, levels are huge, taking several minutes to complete. In these several minutes, there are plenty of opportunities to mess up, and even if they're all fairly easy, there's enough that you're likely to make just one mistake. And once you make that one mistake, you have to start all over. However, for Celeste, each level only takes a few seconds to complete, as long as you don't die. This may seem like it makes the game easy, but the other thing about these smaller levels is that they are far more difficult. While most platformers see you trying to complete several easier obstacles in a row to beat a level, in Celeste there are only one or two obstacles per level, but each one requires mastering it to get through. This produces a very difficult game, but in a very different way than most platformers. Each success you make in Celeste moves the game forward a little bit. Once you've passed an obstacle once, you don't have to pass it again.

Along with this, Celeste has amazing controls. In many platformers, getting the character to move where you want is half of the challenge. However, in Celeste, your character will only move when you're holding down buttons, and will stop almost immediately simply by letting go. This makes it feel like you are the character, due to the precise level of control you have. This precise control is also managed with simple controls, with only four directional buttons, a grab button, and a dash button. This also makes the game incredibly easy to learn, which is good, since the difficulty should come entirely from getting past each level. Through the game, each level gets increasingly difficult, and there are a very large number of them. By the end, it could take almost a thousand tries just to beat one level, which just made the satisfaction when you do beat it that much better.

As well as the shorter levels discussed earlier, every once in a while there are far longer levels that are for more ordinary for a platformer, but still on the short side. While it may seem that these levels may defeat the purpose of the game, they actually make it far better. These levels are all near the end of the game, and are basically building on all previous levels. They seamlessly put what could have been several levels all together, creating a far more pleasing level design. However, these levels are far from pleasing. You will die hundreds of times before beating one, but when you do, it will feel wonderful. You will watch yourself weaving through a beast of a level, and wonder how you did it, and it will be amazing.

#Terraria

Terraria is often seen as 2D Minecraft. However, Terraria is far more than that in several ways. Terraria is, at its core, an adventure game. While you can build things in Terraria, it's just a feature to go alongside its main feature of battling monsters, unlike Minecraft, where battling monsters is the side feature. This makes the two games incredibly different, and not able to be compared, so I will not be comparing them for the remainder of this review.

In Terraria, you start incredibly weak, and will die a lot. However, death isn't that big of a deal, as you will come right back with all of your stuff, other than losing a bit of money. This starting weakness makes several areas in the game which are technically available from the start nearly impossible to explore due to powerful enemies. This makes it so that when you start, you're basically stuck exploring the forest you start in, and gathering resources there to get stronger. Now, while I said earlier that the point of Terraria is fighting monsters, that isn't completely true. The main point of Terraria is getting stronger. This is a constant presence in the game, with early things such as upgrading your copper shortsword to a wooden longsword, but this idea of constant upgrading continues until the end of the game. At the beginning of Terraria, after you gather some basic wooden armor and weapons, you spend most of your time spelunking for better equipment. The caves in Terraria vary a lot depending on where you are, but always have enemies to fight, ores to mine, and loot to gather. However, depending on the biome, the enemies and loot can differ. For example, in an Ice biome, you'll be battling against ice-themed enemies, and gathering equipment such as Ice Skates and the Ice Blade, while in the Jungle, you'll be battling Hornets and Bats, and gathering a lot of nature themed equipment. This keeps your spelunking exciting as you go between biomes.

After you have gathered better equipment from spelunking, you'll probably be ready to do the thing Terraria is best at, a boss fight. There are 31 bosses in the game, and are the primary way to progress. Each boss you defeat will give you better equipment, however many will unlock dangerous new areas of the world. For example, a boss called Skeletron unlocks the Dungeon, an area which was previously inaccessible due to unbreakable blocks, which contains several powerful weapons, as well as many powerful enemies. Each boss in Terraria will require a lot of strategy to defeat, both in picking the weapons to use against them, and in the fight itself. For example, the first main boss, the Eye of Cthulhu, is constantly flying. This makes it so that swords are very difficult to hit it with. However, Grenades, a weapon previously useless due to its bad aim, is incredibly useful against it due to its large hitbox. Almost every boss has a trick like this that makes defeating them far easier, which is an intended feature of the game. As well as this, the ability to build makes it so you can construct arenas for boss fights which will make it so the battle is more in your favor, by adding platforms so you can always maneuver around the boss, or by adding items that make you heal faster. Again, none of this is necessary, but is an intended feature of the game as a way to put effort into making the boss fights more doable.

As each boss is harder than the one before it, and there are 31 of them, the amount that you get stronger from the beginning of the game to the end is immense. At the beginning of the game, you have nothing but some copper tools, but by the end of the game you're nearly invincible, can fly wherever you want, and can destroy nearly any enemy with ease. This sense of slowly growing power is what makes Terraria such a fun game.
