# Celeste

Celeste is the only platformer I've ever beat. And it's an incredibly good one at that, as well as being very unique. The thing that sets it apart from other platformers the most is the level size. I will be defining level as the area between two points which you can restart indefinitely. In most platformers, levels are huge, taking several minutes to complete. In these several minutes, there are plenty of opportunities to mess up, and even if they're all fairly easy, there's enough that you're likely to make just one mistake. And once you make that one mistake, you have to start all over. However, for Celeste, each level only takes a few seconds to complete, as long as you don't die. This may seem like it makes the game easy, but the other thing about these smaller levels is that they are far more difficult. While most platformers see you trying to complete several easier obstacles in a row to beat a level, in Celeste there are only one or two obstacles per level, but each one requires mastering it to get through. This produces a very difficult game, but in a very different way than most platformers. Each success you make in Celeste moves the game forward a little bit. Once you've passed an obstacle once, you don't have to pass it again.

Along with this, Celeste has amazing controls. In many platformers, getting the character to move where you want is half of the challenge. However, in Celeste, your character will only move when you're holding down buttons, and will stop almost immediately simply by letting go. This makes it feel like you are the character, due to the precise level of control you have. This precise control is also managed with simple controls, with only four directional buttons, a grab button, and a dash button. This also makes the game incredibly easy to learn, which is good, since the difficulty should come entirely from getting past each level. Through the game, each level gets increasingly difficult, and there are a very large number of them. By the end, it could take almost a thousand tries just to beat one level, which just made the satisfaction when you do beat it that much better.

As well as the shorter levels discussed earlier, every once in a while there are far longer levels that are for more ordinary for a platformer, but still on the short side. While it may seem that these levels may defeat the purpose of the game, they actually make it far better. These levels are all near the end of the game, and are basically building on all previous levels. They seamlessly put what could have been several levels all together, creating a far more pleasing level design. However, these levels are far from pleasing. You will die hundreds of times before beating one, but when you do, it will feel wonderful. You will watch yourself weaving through a beast of a level, and wonder how you did it, and it will be amazing.
