# Hollow Knight

Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania. Metroidvanias are a genre of game based on Metroid and Castlevania, neither of which I have played, so I don't now how much the current definition applies. However, modern Metroidvanias are platformers where rather than just have a set of levels, one after the other, you explore a large open world. Generally in this open world, certain areas are locked behind certain abilities, which force you onto a relatively linear path, but even then there are ofter bugs or secrets that allow you to skip around. Now, this description of a Metroidvania is also a perfect description of Hollow Knight, as it is simply a really good Metroidvania. Not a work of art, not even particularly unique, just really really good. Now, there is more to it than that, however rather than being uniqueness, it's just the ways it perfects the Metroidvania formula.

The first way that Hollow Knight improves on the formula of a Metroidvania is secrets. Most Metroidvanias have secrets, and Hollow Knight does too. However, in Hollow Knight, every single secret you find will give you something of some use, making it always worth it to look around for secrets. As well as this, the game would be nearly impossible if you never found any of these secrets. This makes it so that everyone who plays Hollow Knight gets at least a few revelatory moments where they find a secret, giving them some kind of power up. These secrets also give a fun thing to do if you're stuck in the game and need a power up to help with a boss fight.

Along with secrets, Hollow Knight also improves on major unlocking of areas. In Roguelikes, the world is fully connected, but you don't have access to all of it due to lack of abilities. For example, there might be a jump you can't get across without a dash ability. In Hollow Knight, most abilities like this are unlocked after boss fights, which are nothing new. The boss fights are especially fun though, with amazing animation, and they're really satisfying to beat. However, along with the fun boss fights, Hollow Knight often has multiple different ability unlocks you can go after by battling different bosses, allowing you to do the game in several different orders even without using special techniques or glitches. As well as this, it gives you other things to do when you're stuck on a particular boss, you can challenge another one.

These two improvements would make Hollow Knight an amazing game by themself, but there's one more thing about Hollow Knight. It's really long. Like, I've played over 100 hours and haven't even beaten a couple bosses and events, though I have unlocked the whole map. So all of these amazing things won't just last a short time before you're done, you'll have tons of time to enjoy all the amazing parts of Hollow Knight.
