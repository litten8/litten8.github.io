# Rain World

One of my favorite feelings in video games is the feeling of exploration. This is a major aspect of both Hollow Knight and Outer Wilds, other games I have reviewed on this site. However, I feel like there has never been a game that did exploration as well as Rain World. Rain World has you playing as a slugcat in a decaying city trying to find your lost family, and not die in the process. While this sounds simple enough, the game seems to put everything it can into making the exploration of this decaying city as immersive and awe-inspiring as possible.

Rain World is a Survival Metroidvania Platformer, a combination of genres that doesn't seem like it should work at all, but they fit together surprisingly well. Now, to be clear, I include both Metroidvania and Platformer there intentionally, it isn't redundant. Something I left out of my Hollow Knight review is that Metroidvanias aren't generally difficult as platformers, and their difficulty comes from fighting enemies and finding the path to new areas of the map. However, that's only a third of the difficulty of Rain World. Sure, you have to wander around the world trying to find where to go next, but while wandering, you have to gather for food, and platform well enough to not waste time.

Now, the most interesting part of Rain World is almost certainly the survival elements. In most games, enemies are either placed intentionally or randomly. However, in Rain World, enemies, as well as other NPCs, live in a living ecosystem. Or, more accurately, a dying ecosystem, as another mechanic of Rain World is that approximately every 15 minutes, heavy rain pours down on the map, which will kill you if you don't sleep in a shelter. Upon waking up at the beginning of each "cycle", tons of other creatures are too, and like you, they need food. Speaking of food, included in the other NPCs I mentioned earlier are prey. While you can hypothetically survive off just fruit in Rain World, it is far easier if you hunt for food. Potential prey ranges from Batflies, which will simply try to run away, but aren't very filling, to Centipedes, dangerous bugs which can electrocute you if you don't kill them, but once you stab them with a spear a couple times, you're going to be done gathering food for the entire cycle.

However, if Rain World was just a survival game, it wouldn't be a very good one. The survival elements, while far more noticeable, I see as complementary to it being a Metroidvania nearly as good as, if not better than, Hollow Knight. Unlike Hollow Knight, or most other Metroidvanias, there are no boss battles. The closest things are running into especially dangerous predators, or particularly difficult platforming sections, but they don't quite function the same. While this does make it so the game never has the feeling of finally beating an area you were stuck on, it more than makes up for it by creating an emergent gameplay experience, and immersing you further into the decaying world of the game.

Unlike the other games I've reviewed here, with the possible exception of Hollow Knight, I haven't actually beaten Rain World. In fact, I'm pretty sure I'm nowhere near beating it. This is because, if I haven't made it clear, the game is really hard. I've played for 27 hours so far though, and I think I have a general idea of where the story is going, sort of, so I felt like I could make a review. However, the difficulty is the one possible downside to Rain World. See, I don't tend to beat video games. Especially long ones, and even more especially difficult ones. Rain World is both. Now, Celeste and Hollow Knight were also both, and I beat them(by a certain definition of the word "beat" in Hollow Knight's case), but I'd say that Rain World is harder than both of these games overall. While Hollow Knight has more difficult boss fights, and Celeste has more difficult platforming, overall, Rain World is far more difficult, and I am unsure if I will ever be able to beat it.
