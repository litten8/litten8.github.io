# Europa Universalis 4

Europa Universalis 4, or as it's more commonly called, EU4, is what is known as a Grand Strategy Game. Grand Strategy games are games that focus on overall strategy, but rather than just controlling an army or something small scale, you control an entire country. In EU4 specifically, you control a country on the verge of the Age of Discovery, one of the most exciting times in human history.

Now, EU4 is a very old game, by the standards of other games still getting frequent major updates. It originally came out in 2013, but it just received an update overhauling several major features of the game just earlier this year, in 2020. The way Paradox, the company that makes it, is able to afford building up so much on this single game is its DLCs. These are EU4's most controversial feature, same with all modern Paradox games, however I believe it is 100% worth it. However, I might be biased, since I can afford the over 100 dollars to get all the DLCs that change the game normally. However, that number isn't as crazy as it sounds. For one thing, most features considered necessary are added to the game for free, with the DLCs only adding special things specific to only certain nations. For example, in the most recent update, they completely changed the way the estates and mercenaries worked for free, however their overhaul of the Holy Roman Empire was in the DLC. Due to this, depending on what countries you play, most of the DLC won't be necessary. But if you want to play countries all around the world, you probably do want all the DLCs. However, if you want to do that, you're probably playing the game enough that it is worth it! Along with all these, a recent thing has been added where rather than buying all the DLCs, you can just pay a monthly subscription to get all the DLCs, which is far cheaper.

These years of development have made EU4 into an absolutely huge game, completely filled with content. I've played for over 1000 hours, and I've barely scratched the surface! One thing that makes it so easy to add content to EU4 without making it feel bloated is its scope. EU4 takes place across the entire world, over nearly four centuries. And you can play as any country that existed during that time. Chances are, the country you live in is in EU4, and has some exclusive content for them! And even if not, there's a chance that content for your country will be added in future updates or DLCs.

Now, what kind of game is EU4? It's a ridiculously complicated one. In EU4, you manage nearly every aspect of your country, from economy, to trade, to diplomacy, to war. While many of these features aren't as deep as other games, the fact that EU4 has all of them, and that they all interact with each other, is what makes EU4 amazing. Sure, you might not be able to exactly customize what resources you trade, and with who, and what you produce, and you can't decide on the exact model of weapon each of your armies uses. However, I believe that if you could do all these things, EU4 would become near impossible. Instead, there are abstractions of these things, such as Trade Nodes, and you getting to decide how much of your army has artillery or horses. And even with these abstractions, EU4 is incredibly difficult to understand! However, once you do figure everything out, it's incredibly rewarding to build your way up from a tiny country in south east asia to an empire owning half of china, or to go from a war-torn England to a massive colonial empire! Speaking of which, the first of those two things never happened in history, which is another reason why EU4 is great. It allows you to see alternate ways history could have panned out. Sure, it's not exactly accurate, but it's still accurate enough that it's very cool.
