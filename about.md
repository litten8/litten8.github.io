# About Me

I am AGWIC, which stands for A Girl Who Is Creative. I really like acronyms. My name is Bernie, and I'm a 17 year old author and programmer. I really like writing stories, as well as programming games. I play a lot of video games, so I occasionally write reviews for them. I also like rambling, ranting, arguing, and talking in general about most things.
