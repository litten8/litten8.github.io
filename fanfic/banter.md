#Banter

Banter is the first fanfiction I ever wrote, and the first writing I ever put publicly on the internet. That lack of experience shows. I've included the author's notes here, since I feel like they contextualize some things. You can read it in the form I originally posted it on Spacebattles [here](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/banter-altpower-taylor.774622/#post-59960716) and on Sufficient Velocity [here](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/banter-altpower-taylor.57375/#post-12974271).

#Chapter 1

I recently discovered Worm fanfiction, and came up with some ideas to write some. I decided to start with the one I was least attached to, write a first chapter, and attempt to revise it based on what people said. I'm kind of new to forums in general, as well as fanfiction in general, so if I do anything wrong, or stupid, or rude, or otherwise bad, tell me. I tried to read all of the rules, but there didn't seem to be very many, so I'm afraid I missed some.

Also, the tile is just there because I needed a title, but I think I came up with a bad one. I just named it that since it gives Taylor a talking based power, so I picked a mostly random talking based word.

Anyways, here's my current first draft of the first chapter of this fanfiction:

The locker door opened. And the one who was opening it was Emma! How did that happen? I could tell from my sore throat that I had been screaming, but I can't imagine how anything I said could lead to here saving me. Upon further investigation, she was crying.

She began talking through her tears. "I'm so sorry Taylor! I didn't know how much of a bitch I was being!" Wow, she had gotten really good at fake crying. Most of the time she did this kind of thing she just didn't try.


"Fuck you." I said, interrupting what would likely lead into a session of mocking.


"Wait! No!" She screamed. "I'm serious this time! What you said made me realize what an asshole I've been for the past two years." Now here came the mention of it being my fault because of my mother's death. "I can't believe I fell for that bitch Sophia's lies!"


…

"What."


"I told you I was serious! I always blamed it on you, but it was my fault."

I didn't know what to say. It was completely out of character for her to actually realize this kind of thing, but I don't see how this could lead into her mocking me. What had I said in that locker?

Emma just sat down and cried more. I figured staying here wouldn't accomplish anything either way, so I started to get up, but found I couldn't. Fuck, I was going to need to go to the hospital.

After I got out of the hospital, one thing was clear: I had powers. People actually believed me when I told them about the bullying, which couldn't happen without powers, or at least not with the reactions people gave. I guess I got the power to be more convincing? That might explain some of what happened with Emma. Of course when I get a power, it's the most useless one possible. However, I did still have the option to become a hero. I spent the drive home trying to think of a way I could use my powers in a way that didn't seem culty.

I got home, and I was left with no good options. I had plenty of meh options though. I should go through all of them in my head before I make my decision.

1. I tell my dad and try to figure out the specifics of my power before going out to fight crime. However, I really didn't want to tell my dad.

2. just don't use my powers. This is not an option because I have powers! I need to be a superhero, otherwise I'd be betraying my past self!

3. I just go out and try to fight crime myself. However, I wasn't sure if my power made me so convincing that I could stop criminals by just saying "you should stop commiting crime."

4. I find someone else to tell. The problem is, I have no friends, and have had none since Emma. Oh, that reminded me of that last mocking she did when she opened the locker. Fuck her.

5. I join a villain team and pretend to be evil while actually doing good. This has the problem that I'm pretty sure my power has the downside of making my lies less convincing. Also, of course, I don't want to be a villain. This was definitely the worst idea I came up with.

6. I join New Wave. This has the downside that my identity would be public, so my dad would have to know, which I don't want.

7. I join the Wards. This felt like the only option that didn't have a huge downside, but it still felt… wrong. What if the Wards were just like Winslow? They wouldn't, the Wards were heroes.

I decided that my only choice was to join the Wards, or at least talk to the PRT. I decided to wait a few days to make sure I wouldn't change my mind(and also because I just got out of the hospital).

School for the next few days was fairly uneventful, considering that Emma seemed to have given up bullying me, but Sophia and Madison were still at it. The whole thing with Emma constantly trying to apologize was annoying, but I guess it was better than her helping with the bullying.

In those few days, I managed to buy a domino mask and some clothes that looked vaguely costume-y. I would let the PRT decide on my name(or more likely, PHO would decide for them) and costume.

I decided to go into the PRT building, and found another cape there. She seemed to have arrived very recently, and was talking to the person at the front desk. "I would like to sign up for the Wards." She said, very confidently. I walked up behind her, and said, in a much less confident voice "Uh, I don't know who you are, but I would also like to join the Wards."


The person at the front desk seemed surprised. "Wow, two new capes in one day! And just a week after that new villain, Chatterbox, showed up. Could you two, uh, verify you have powers?"


"I have powers." I said, demonstrating my powers.


"I asked for verification, I wasn't saying I didn't believe you." The woman said.


"Huh, that makes things more difficult." I said, thinking for a bit.


"I can show her my power while you think." The other new cape said. "My name is Interrogator, and I have the power to ask questions." Interrogator doesn't seem like a very heroic name. But it did seem to fit a power involving asking questions, whatever it was.


"Uh, can't anyone ask questions?" The woman asked nervously, echoing my thoughts.


"Can they?"


"Uh, yeah."


"Oh, right. Hmm..." Interrogator thought for a bit. "Uh, where did you grow up?"


"Uh, here, in Brockton bay. Why did you need to know that?"


"See? That was my power!" We both looked at her, confused, "I make people answer questions!"


"I would have answered that anyways."


"Hmm, okay. Try to lie in the next question I ask you."


"Sure?" The woman seemed confused. Interrogator seemed to be having a similar problem to my own, but her power definitely seemed more concrete than mine.


"What's your favorite color?" As soon as Interrogator finished asking the question, the woman froze up.


"B-B-B…" She muttered, trying to say blue, but eventually she blurted out "Red." That was an interesting power. Potentially very powerful, though I assume people who were skilled at lying might be able to bypass it.


"There. That's proof of my power."


"Uh, most capes will give video evidence or something. It's quite unorthodox to demonstrate the power, especially on some random person like me."


"Oops, sorry." Interrogator seemed a bit embarrassed by that.


I started talking again. "I just triggered a bit over a week ago, so I don't have video evidence of my powers. They're more… subtle than that. So, I doubt I could give a demonstration here. Could you please –" No, I could use my power for this. "You should just trust me. If you get caught, I'll take the blame."


"Okay, sure." There was my power at work, making the woman have no second thoughts about me. She pressed a button on her desk and said into a microphone "Two new capes joining the Wards." A few minutes later, another woman came and led us through a hallway to an elevator.

# Chapter 2

I wrote a second chapter, which is hopefully less rushed than the last one:

When the elevator stopped, the woman lead us through a hallway into a room where there were some of the Brockton Bay Wards. Aegis, Shadow Stalker, and Vista were in the room. I can't believe I got to meet actual heroes! Sure, they were Wards, but it was better than nothing.


I glanced over at Interrogator, who seemed to tense up upon entering the room, but I couldn't tell why. Did she recognize one of the Wards?


The woman began talking to Aegis, the leader of the Wards. "Two new capes came in within minutes of each other asking to become Wards!"


"Oh? What are their powers?" Aegis asked.


"Interrogator," She said as she gestured her way, "can ask questions that are very difficult, if not impossible to answer in a lie. The other one couldn't demonstrate her power, but she seems trustworthy."


"That's my power." I said, finally feeling confident. "People believe me when I tell them the truth, so she believed me when I told her to trust me that I had powers."


"That…" Aegis started, his expression turning to worry, "Is a pretty terrifying power. It's good you joined us, and not the villains." I didn't really see the power as much, but maybe that was because I had never tested it.


By the time the woman from the front desk had gone back, Aegis announced, "So, I guess it's time for introductions! You know, say your name and show your face." When he said that, Interrogator tensed up. "You two should probably go first."


I glanced over at Interrogator, since she seemed like she would want to go first, but she was staring directly at Shadow Stalker very nervously. I decided to introduce myself first. I took off my mask and said "I'm Taylor–"


Before I could say anything else, Shadow Stalker started laughing, and Interrogator stared at me in shock. Did they go to Winslow? Aegis glared at Shadow Stalker, and she quieted down, but was still clearly amused. I was beginning to regret joining the Wards, if some of them went to Winslow.


Interrogator seemed terrified for some reason. Why would someone be scared of me? She took off her mask, and said "I'm Emma Barnes–"


I quickly cut her off, "What? When did you get powers? You've done nothing but bully me for the past two years, and I'm sure you would use your power to help with that!"


"I only got my powers a week ago." She said timidly, very uncharacteristic of both what I knew of Emma, and what I knew of Interrogator. "When I… I…"


Shadow Stalker started laughing again, even harder than when I said my name. She started talking through her laughs. "Wait, that wasn't a joke? I thought you just hadn't told me about it to add to the realism or whatever. Well, anyways," She took off her mask. "I'm Sophia Hess." What? What?


"Huh… Wha… How?" I mumbled.


Before this mess could continue, Aegis cut us off. "I don't know what is going on here, but how about me and Vista introduce ourselves?" Before we could respond he said "I'm Carlos, and,"


Vista quickly said "I'm Missy."


I ignored the attempt to change the conversation. "How is she a hero!?" I exclaimed, pointing angrily at Sophia. "She's a bully!"


"I mean, she's only a probationary Ward." Aegis, or Carlos, said calmly.


Vista, now Missy, spoke up. "Welcome to the club. Everyone here hates Sophia. But I guess we just have to put up with her."


"Put up with her!?" I yelled, "I've been putting up with her for two years, and look at where it got me! I was just hospitalized by her and Emma here shoving me in a locker!"


"That's…" Carlos said, "Definitely enough to end her probationary agreement." He glared at Sophia.


"She's been doing shit like this for two years!" I yelled.


"I can testify to that being true." Emma said. What was going on with her?


Sophia started teasing Emma, "Oh, no longer pred–"


"Shut up." Emma responded. "Do you really think I believe your stupid philosophy anymore!?"


Sophia stuttered. "Um, Maybe?"


"No." Emma said sternly, her voice suddenly rising in volume beyond what was normal. A second power maybe? Or maybe it was just my brain. "You tricked me into believing that shit for two years and lost me my best friend!" She gestured toward me. "She made me realize that when she was yelling in that locker."


I realized what had happened, and by the look on Carlos' face, he had too. I had used my power when I was screaming in that locker. Carlos suddenly started talking. "Both of you, stop talking! Taylor is clearly a much more powerful Master than she realized, to the point of causing a trigger event. We need to find out the details of her power before we let her say anything more."

#Chapter 3

I stayed silent, not knowing if my powers would be able to make them change their minds about how dangerous I was before they retaliated. Carlos began walking out of the room, and gestured for me to follow.


As I followed Carlos into the basement, I thought about how bad this had gone. I realized that I could probably use my power to make friends, who I could have help me. I didn't need to join the Wards. Well, it was too late now. I was probably going to end up in the Birdcage or something just because I didn't fully think through my power.


As expected, he lead me into a cell. I assumed the cell was designed for holding Masters, due to the fact that I was one. About a minute after I entered the cell, a speaker sounded with Carlos' voice(or should I go back to calling him Aegis?). "Taylor, you are not being imprisoned. You are being temporarily detained until we figure out your powers." I was getting detained. This is not how I expected the day to go.


I waited in the cell for a bit, presumably as Aegis and the PRT figured out what to do with me. They couldn't send me to the birdcage, right? All I had done was try to join the Wards, I just had a dangerous power. I'm not even sure if the birdcage would work, now that I thought about it, unless they removed my ability to speak, and even then, I felt like my power might work for other forms of communication.


Eventually, I heard a voice. Except, this time, it was Emma's. "What's your favorite color?" What? I thought the room was soundproof. Maybe they turned on some kind of recording device? Wasn't that dangerous?


Without thinking about it, the word "black" came out of my mouth. I guess that was my favorite color. Wait, why hadn't they locked up Emma too? Or did they already do that, and the reason it had taken so long to get to me is because they were testing her.


The voice changed back to Aegis. "Say that your favorite color is black."


I said "My favorite color is black." This continued for a bit, with several variations on the phrase, such as having me say "Black is the best color" or "I really like the color Black". Eventually, he changed to having me say false things, like that my favority color was white. He also had me say some things using visual signals, presumably to see if my powers worked through those. I was eventually given some paper to write on, to see if my power worked through that. However, he never gave me any results, so I didn't actually know.


Eventually, after what was at least an hour of saying meaningless stuff, I was let out of my cell. Aegis was at the door, and told me "We have determined that as long as you are careful about what you say, you are safe enough." Safe enough to not go in the Birdcage? I better not ask.


"So, I can join the Wards?" I asked, hopefully.


"Yes. It will be very useful to have a Master/Stranger 6 on our team." Wow. Master/Stranger 6? That's really strong.


"Thank you!" I exclaimed. I then remembered something. "Uh, on an unrelated note, what are you going to do about Sophia?"


"A lot of investigation. Chances are, she'll be sent to juvinile detention, considering that we now know that your power only works with true statements." Phew. That was good.


"What about Emma?" I asked. She was even worse to me than Sophia was most of the time, but she did testify that she and Sophia had been bullying me.


"She will be a probationary member, like Sophia was, due to her cooperation with telling us about the bullying campaign against you." Figures. I thought she deserved what Sophia would probably get, but she did seem to be having a change of heart.


"Well, I was hoping for worse," I sighed, "but I understand that decision."


"You're going to have to deal with her, she will be on the same team as you."


"I guess I can."


"Also, please don't ever insult anyone, even if they deserve, without permission. We have determined from what Emma has told us that you insulting someone will result in them genuinely believing themselves to be as bad as you saw them in the moment of the insult." That was bad. Sophia seemed fine, and so did Madison. Had they accepted that they were terrible people?


Wait.


Hadn't I yelled at the bystanders when I was in the locker? None of them opened the door, so I yelled at them. If even one of them was paying attention to what I was saying, very bad things could happen. Chances are, many of them listened. When I got back to school, I really needed to make some kind of announcement taking back what I said.


But that would require revelaing my powers to the entire school. Maybe I could find the specific people who looked the saddest, and try to compliment them, counteracting what I did? Sure, I would accidentally probably make a couple people happy that were sad for different reasons, but that was a good thing, right?


I decided to tell Aegis. He was the leader of the Wards, he would know what to do. "Yeah, I think I may have insulted a lot of people in the school while I was in that locker. You know, bystanders."


"That is not good. How many people do you think heard?" Carlos asked.


"A lot. It was a pretty big scene."


"That is very bad. I'll try to think of a solution for that."


"Uh, I was thinking that maybe complimenitng them would counteract that?" I asked.


"Well, yeah. But how would you go about that without unmasking yourself? There's a good chance one of the people you insulted triggered and got powers, like Emma did, and since there haven't been any new heroes recently…" He trailed off, as if expecting me to say what was now obvious


"Chatterbox." I said. Chatterbox was a new villain with the power to modify her voice in various ways. Her joining of the Undersiders bumped them up from a minor villain group that no one had heard about to something closer in level of relevance to the Merchants.


"You need to find her, and convince her to stop being a villain." Carlos said. I nodded, and he continued. "Also, maybe try to get her to join the Wards?"

#Chapter 4

I went on vacation for a bit, and this was a bit of an awkward chapter. Here it is:

"That's…" I was going to say that it was a terrible idea, but my power had shown itself to be powerful enough to get Emma to start trying to be a good person. "Not quite as bad of an idea as it sounds like!"


We were walking back to the room were the Wards were, and in the few hours I was gone, Sophia had left(presumably for good), and the remaining Wards had showed up. Clockblocker, Kid Win, and Gallant. After dropping me off, Carlos left, presumably to deal with our plan to make Chatterbox stop being a villain.


"Hey, new Ward!" Clockblocker said enthusiastically. "I guess the rest of us should introduce ourselves again?"


"Yeah, I guess." I said. "Wait, again?"


"Yeah, we already introduced ourselves to Emma after she had her powers investigated." That confirmed my suspiscions of why it took so long for them to get to me.


"Huh. Well, I'm Taylor, and I don't have a cape name yet."


"Oh, you do not want to leave your name up to the PRT." Clockblocker said. I wonder what kind of name they came up with for him after he announced his current one publicly. Probably wasn't very good given that statement.


"Or PHO for that matter." Kid Win said. "You should really come up with one before you do anything. Anyways, I'm Chris."


"I'm Dennis." Clockblocker said.


"And I'm Dean." Said Gallant.


"Well, that was a lot calmer than the last set of introductions." I sighed.


"Speaking of those," Dennis noted, "Thank you so much for getting rid of Sophia!" He started grinning.


"Hah, looks like I'm not the only who hated her guts." I laughed. These were people who I could actually have as friends!


"Well, you need to come up with a name now, before the PRT does." Dennis said, "I suggest –"


"You do not want to have him come up with your name." Missy interrupted.


"Redeemer seems like a good name." Emma said. "Since you can use your power to redeem villains, kinda like you redeemed me." I guess it was a fine name. Sounded heroic enough, and described how I planned to use my power.


"That definitely breaks the unwritten rules." Missy said.


"It looks like Carlos isn't the only one who saw that use of my power." I said. "He said that I should go try to do that to Chatterbox, since the chances are high that I am the reason she became a villain. Kind of like Emma, but in reverse."


"The Undersiders will chase you down and kill you for that." Missy said. She was taking this really seriously for being the youngest one here.


"Chances are that she's being not very villainous." I said. I then came up with an idea. "Emma, do you remember the exact words I used to insult the bystanders?"


"No," Emma sighed, "But I'm pretty sure you said something about them being just as bad as, well, me, Madison, and Sophia."


"Wow, as bad as Sophia? That's a pretty bad insult!" Dennis joked.


"Yeah, so I guess I need to tell her she wasn't a bad person for not opening the locker? That way I don't really Master her, instead I just reverse the effects of my previous Mastering of her."


"There are so many ways that could backfire." Missy said.


"Yeah, but if I let her stay a villain, then every bad thing she does will be my fault. I have to at least try to fix this."


"Wait," Chris said, "How are you going to find Chatterbox so you can redeem her?"


"Uh, I dunno. Is there a paticular area I should patrol to increase my chance of finding the Undersiders?" I asked.


"No." Dean said, "The Undersiders commit their crimes throughout the city. You just need to do a lot of patrols, and hope to find them."


"Well, I guess I should wait for Carlos to come back to see if he got my patrols set up right." I said, "Also, shouldn't I tell him that I'm going to go by Redeemer?"


A speaker in the room sounded with Carlos' voice. "We are know, as we have been listening to this conversation to make sure that you didn't accidentally master anyone."


After waiting around for a few minutes, Carlos came back into the room, and told me "You and Interrogator's costumes will be ready on Monday. Come back then, and you will begin your work as Wards."


"Okay, um, should we leave then?" I asked.


"Yes, I'm sure your parents are wondering where you are." Carlos said.


"Wait," Emma said, "Shouldn't we talk to Gle – Er, the PR people before they make our costumes?"


"They're," Carlos hesitated, "A bit afraid of Taylor, and they're pretty high up in the PRT, and you do remember our agreement, right?"


"Yeah," Emma sighed. "I'm not allowed near any PRT members with classified information."


"Wait," I interrupted, "Couldn't she just have everything she says recorded and screened before being sent to the high ranking people?"


Carlos looked thoughtful. "That could work." He said. "I'll talk about it, but you should be getting home, since I doubt they will trust you enough for something like that. Just hope that they come up with something good."


"Okay." I wasn't used to being feared, but since I have my power I had to deal with it. "Well, bye!" I waved, and left the building.

#Chapter 5

School was surreal, knowing that Emma had a power, and everything she was doing to stand up against bullies was due to me mastering her. I was glad she was doing it, since my power kind of made it hard to stand up to bullies myself without risking a lot. Even with this, I couldn't allow myself to forgive Emma. It took being mastered to get her to stop bullying me, so even if she wasn't bullying me anymore, she wasn't a trustworthy friend.


I also couldn't help but look around to try to figure out which of my classmates was Chatterbox. Most people seemed to act normally, or as normally as one could suspect without Sophia. I felt like Madison might be a suspect until I saw her happily hanging out with her other friends. I thought she was close to Sophia, but maybe I had accidentally redeemed her similarly to how I redeemed Emma? I didn't bother thinking about it.


Even with all the weirdness, school was pleasant for the first time in a long time. Last week, the belief that Emma was setting up for an elaborate prank was gnawing at the back of my head, so I couldn't really enjoy myself. But now, I could at least enjoy parts of school. I still had no friends, but I also didn't have bullies constantly after me.


Eventually, school ended, and Emma walked up to me. "So, Taylor, we get to get our costumes now! Then we get to be real capes!" She said excitedly. She sounded almost like she did before we stopped being friends, which somehow made it harder to trust her.


"Yeah. Exactly like we always wanted. Back when we were friends."


"We can be friends again! You redeemed me!"


"No, this isn't you. I can't trust someone who literally took being mastered to stop being a terrible person. For all I know, my power will wear off, or something else will happen that will make you be a bitch again."


"I…" Her voice went back down in pitch to the voice of the Emma I had known for the past two years. "I guess I understand that." After she said that, we walked to the PRT building in silence.


When we got to the PRT room, both of our costumes were ready. My costume looked as much like a generic hero costume as possible, a skin-tight suit in bright colors. I guess they thought that if I was making other people into heroes, I had to look like a generic hero? I dunno. Maybe this was just a leftover costume for some other cape. Whatever.


Interrogator's costume looked like a stylized police uniform, or something like that. It was a somewhat baggy black costume with a loudspeaker hooked onto the belt, presumably to allow her voice to go a longer distance.


Along with our costumes were our PRT classifications. I was a Master 8, which was only one away from being high enough to authorize missiles! Emma was a more reasonable Master 4, but she had a sub-classification of Thinker 7, likely due to her ability to get information out of anyone that wasn't deliberately trying to hide it.


We got our patrol schedules, and found that all of my patrols were with Emma. "What!?" I exclaimed. "Why do I have to have all my patrols with her? Do you know how unnerving it is just to be around her at school?"


Carlos cut me off. "If you do run into the Undersiders, she will be very helpful for redeeming Chatterbox."


I guess that was true. "Fine. But once I'm done with Chatterbox, I'd rather not be on patrols with her."


Emma looked very sad, which just made me feel even worse. Everything that was happening to her now was my fault, and I didn't even mean to do this! I mean, she deserved worse, but mastering someone does not sit well with my conscience!


My first patrol was by the docks with Vista and Interrogator. I've seen Vista trap people with her power, so she would be very helpful if we run into the Undersiders.


Before we left, we also reviewed the powers of the Undersiders. Grue could create a dark fog that disabled senses, Regent could slowly take over your body, Tattletale was some kind of Thinker, and claimed to read minds, Hellhound had the power to make dogs into monstrous creatures, and Chatterbox had the ability to empower her voice in various ways, one of which was cancelling the powers of anyone who is listening.


Chatterbox's Trump power could be worrying, but worst case scenario we could gag her. However, it was likely that she would cooperate with us due to my powers alongside Interrogator's.


We left the building, prepared to search for the Undersiders and take on any crime we found, when suddenly we started hearing a voice.


"Testing, testing, testing," The voice was loud, and seemed to be coming from all directions. It was pretty obviously Chatterbox, as I noticed that I couldn't tune out her voice, which was a sign that she was using her Trump power. "Okay, I think I've hit my limit. Hello! I am Chatterbox, member of the Undersiders, a team of capes in Brockton Bay. I'm pretty sure that only people in Brockton Bay can hear me, but the city isn't perfectly round, so there's a chance that you don't live there." I noticed that her voice sounded surprisingly cheery for someone who genuinely believed she was a terrible person. Maybe she was being controlled by Regent?


She continued talking, "So, the reason I'm talking to you all, is mainly just to make the Undersiders well known. Having more people know about us is great!" Is Chatterbox/Regent an idiot? There's now way an experienced villain like Regent would do something like this, but it didn't make sense for this to be just Chatterbox. "Also, if you want to pay tribute to us for whatever reason, our base is at –" Suddenly she was cut off. After a bit, her voice returned, "Apparently telling everyone in the city the location of our base is not an idea supported by the rest of the group. But, if you do want to give us tribute, just yell our name in the docks, we'll find you eventually. Bye!"

#Chapter 6

School started, so I'll be writing chapters slower now. This compounds with the fact that it's difficult to write characters in confusing situation, which this chapter is:

What.


That calls for a change of plans. I mean, they'd obviously have a trap prepared, but I doubt they could handle the entire Wards team working together, right?


It seemed that Aegis had come up with the same idea as me, as he was coming out of the PRT HQ with the rest of the Wards, as well as Armsmaster. Either that, or he was here to stop me.


"Uh," I started. I definitely needed to say something, but I couldn't decide what. "what do we do?" I decided to ask.


"I was thinking a full on assault." Aegis said. "Even if they're prepared to ambush us, I doubt they expected all of us." Then, I noticed that the Brockton Bay Protecterate were coming out of the HQ behind the Wards.


"Don't you think that involving the actual Protecterate members is a bit… Overkill?" I asked.


Armsmaster walked in front of Aegis, "This has shown how potentially powerful Chatterbox is. Capturing her and the rest of the Undersiders is an amazing oppurtunity."


"So we're just gonna go out to the docks and start yelling for the Undersiders?" Assualt asked, clearly trying not to laugh.


Armsmaster paused for a bit. "Yes. We should start soon, before the Undersiders convince Chatterbox to not look for people calling for them."


We walked out to the middle of the docks, and Triumph used his power to amplify himself calling out "Undersiders! Undersiders!"


Almost immediately, Chatterbox appeared out of an alleyway. "Wow, the whole Brockton Bay Wards team and Protecterate giving tribute to us? Was I really that intimidating?" The rest of the Undersiders appeared from behind her, Hellhound having two dogs with her. Chatterbox was disabling our powers with her voice, but she was also disabling her teammates. She also seemed to be disabling our ability to think.


She kept talking "So, you're giving us the tribute of five containment foam grenades and launchers? We don't have much use for them, but–" She paused just long enough for the five capes who had been given the containment foam grenades to launch them at the Undersiders. Chatterbox's power made this too easy! She was hurting her teammates way more than she was hurting us, but the battle was basically over now.


"Well, that was easy." I thought it was someone on our side, but it was actually Chatterbox talking from in the containment foam. "Though honestly, I was expecting just the Wards to come. That's why I set things up to be so easy. If I had known that you would be so intimidated, I might have chosen a strategy that was less risky for me."


She paused, presumably to let us think. Specifically, so we could realize that she had betrayed the Undersiders. If that was true, then it was possible that she wasn't as stupid as she seemed. However, her plan was not a very good one in my opinion. Like she said, it was too risky for her.


"So, yeah. I was a double agent. Pretending to work for the Undersiders, but actually working for the heroes! I was so secret, that not even the heroes knew!" She had turned off her power and thought disabling effect, swapping it for one of her more subtle effects. "But yeah, I still expect you to put me in a cell and interrogate me or whatever. You wouldn't be doing your job right if you didn't! I'll stop talking now, so you can go do that."


We packed the Undersiders into a van so they could be detained by the PRT. Once they were in cells, Interrogator and I were to interrogate them, and try to get them to become probationary members of the Wards.


We went back to the PRT HQ, and went into Chatterbox's cell. She was the first we were going to interrogate, since she had already shown interest in becoming a hero.


Emma spoke first. "Why did you become a villain?" She asked.


"Uh, well, that's a long story." She said, her voice turning to a sadtone. I felt bad for her, but I'm not sure if it was because of her power, or because I was pretty sure why she did become a villain. "See, there was this kid at school who was shoved in a locker by bullies. After a while of being in there, she started yelling. At one point, she was saying how bad we were being for just standing by and watching, that we were just as bad as the bullies. I, uh, kinda took it personally. Very personally. So personally I passed out, I guess. When I woke up, I had powers. I decided that if I had powers, and was just as bad as the bullies, I should become a villain. I decided to join the Undersiders through process of elimination. I'm not white, I'm not Asian, I don't want to go on drugs, and I'm not a mercenary." After she went silent for a bit, I assumed she was done talking. That sounded about right, and it was guarenteed to be true given Emma's power.


"What happened after that?" Emma asked. I figured she wanted to figure out what had led her to betray her team.


"Oh, well I realized I wasn't as bad as the bullies like a day after I joined the Undersiders. I decided I still should make up for being a bystander when that girl was in her locker by becoming a hero. While I could have just left and joined the Wards, I decided to go along with them for a week or two to build their trust, and then I would turn them in to the PRT!" Her voice had returned from the sad tone to her normal upbeat happy tone. "So, can I join the Wards now?" She looked up at me and Emma with pleading eyes.


"We don't make that decision." I said. "We just have powers suited toward interrogation and recruitment."


"Well, I do have one more question, just to make sure." Emma said. "Do you intend to be a good hero as a member of the Wards?"


"Well, yeah." She said. "Did you just need me to say that for the record?"


"Uh, sort of." Emma said. "My power guarantees you tell the truth when you answer my questions, so I had to ask that just to make sure. So, after we finish talking to the rest of the Undersiders, you can join the Wards!"


"Awesome. Just out of curiosity, what's your power?" She looked at me. "She told me her power, so I figured it would be fine."


"I'm really convincing." I said.


"Huh." Chatterbox said. "Well, hurry up interrogating the others, I wanna meet the Wards!"


"Uh, okay." I said, "Bye." I waved as me and Emma left the cell.

#Chapter 7

The next person for us to interrogate was Hellhound, Rachel Lindt. As soon as we walked into the room, Emma asked her first question. "Why did you become a villain?"


Hellhound responded after a short hesitation, glaring. "To protect my dogs." What? How does protecting dogs lead to becoming a villain?


Emma looked as shocked as me, but asked the next question. "Why do you need to be a villain to protect your dogs?"


"Because I need money, and criminals can't exactly get any other job." Ah, there's the confusion. She was a criminal first, and then officially became a villain when she joined the Undersiders.


"And why did you become a criminal?" Emma was exasperated. This was going to to take a lot more questions than Chatterbox.


"Because someone was hurting my dog, so I killed them." Hellhound responded, acting like that was a normal thing to do. Looks like she wasn't joining the Wards.


"Well, you're going to go to prison then. Hurting a dog is not a good reason to kill people." I said.


"Maybe." Hellhound was being incredibly uncooperative. "If I go to prison, make sure to take care of my dogs."


"I don't have any control over what the PRT does to your dogs." I said.


Hellhound looked scared for a split second, before her face turned to anger, and she started struggling against her restraints. "Fuck the PRT! All I want is for my dogs to be fucking safe!"


Emma decided to ask a question. "Why do you care so much about your dogs?" That was about the least helpful question she could have asked.


"Because they're my dogs!" Hellhound screamed.


I was worried she might escape, so I told Emma "Let's go." And we shut the door behind us. There was no way she was getting through that.


We weren't interrogating Regent or Tattletale, as Regent was already on the way to the Bird Cage, and Tattletale was likely immune to Emma's power. So, we just had to interrogate Grue.


Just like with Hellhound, Emma immediately asked "Why did you become a villain?"


Grue seemed to resist answering. "To… To get money. So that I could afford to get custody of my sister. So that she can get away from our father. So I can protect her."


Crap. I don't know how I was supposed to talk about this. Should I just let the PRT people get him? I mean, I could probably easily get him to join the Wards by explaining that he could get money from the Wards, but would that be immoral, turning a villain using my Master power? I'm not qualified to do philosophical musings. I'll just do what I was told to do, and that was recruiting him.


"You," Crap, I was stuttering, "You could make money if you joined the Wards. And if you don't join the Wards, you'll just be sent to prison. Can't exactly get custody of your sister if you're in prison." Was that crossing the line? Fuck.


"Can't exactly get custody of her if I've been a supervillain for two years either." He said.


"Yeah, but with Interrogator's power, the PRT now knows that the primary reason you became a villain was to protect your sister. They'll be able to help you."


"Are you sure?" He asked. Crap. Now came the downside of my power.


"No, but it's got a better chance of working than going to prison." I said.


"Well, I guess I have no other choice." He sighed, sounding defeated, "I'll join the Wards."


I left the room, feeling confused. Joining the Wards was so obviously the right choice for him in my opinion, so it didn't feel like I had mastered him at all. But that doesn't change the fact that I did. If this is breaking the unwritten rules, then I guess I could just blame the PRT.


I decided to ask Emma what she thought. "What do you think about me mastering Grue?"


"What do you mean?" She asked, oblivious to what I was thinking.


"Is it moral?" And now I sounded like Socrates.


"Uh, why wouldn't it be?"


"I used a Master power to get him to change sides."


"So? You did what was best for him. You did the same thing to me, and I'm glad." Right. I forgot that Emma had been mastered by me too.


"Right, nevermind." I figured if I wanted to talk about morals, it shouldn't be with the girl who had been my friend, and then bullied me for two years, and then thought that she could make up for it.


As I walked back to the Wards room, Chatterbox started talking, presumably to the whole city. "Hey Brockton Bay, this is Chatterbox! Just in case it wasn't entirely obvious, my last message was a trap! However, it was not a trap for the heroes, but a trap for the Undersiders! I was actually an undercover hero the whole time! Well, not the whole time but… Uh, anyways, I'm gonna join the Wards now! Bye!"


I'm not sure what the purpose of her saying that was, but it didn't cause any problems. Chatterbox was weird, and it looked like we couldn't stop that.


We went back to the Wards room, and waited for Chatterbox and Grue to finish their agreement to become probationary members of the Wards. Chatterbox was the first to speak up. "So now we get to introduce ourselves, right?" She said, smiling with joy.


"Yeah –" Before Carlos could finish replying, Chatterbox interrupted.


"I'm Carla! Ooh, I can introduce my power too!"


"We know your–" I said, before getting cut off.


"I can make my voice impossible to ignore, disable powers, increase or decrease in volume, have any origin point, give some emotion to people who hear it, be more convincing, or imitate other people's voices!" That was a big power set, bigger than I thought. "I do have the downside of only being able to use 3 effects at one time though." That was the same limitation of Eidolon. Huh.


After a short silence, Grue introduced himself. "I'm Brian." His introduction contrasted a lot with Chatterbox, or Carla as I should now think of her.


The rest of the Wards went around introducing themselves until only me and Emma were left. As Missy finished her introduction, Chatterbox asked "So, who are the two new girls?"


"Uh, we joined on Saturday." I said. "Today was supposed to be our first patrol, but then you made your announcement."


"And then you captured us. Right." Carla said.


"My power is the ability to convince anyone of anything that I already believe that isn't subjective." I said. "And I think my power is probably what caused your 'descent into villainy'." I said that in airquotes, as she only was actually a villain at heart for a day or so.


"How would that happen?" Carla asked.


"I'm Taylor Hebert."


Her eyes widened "The locker girl?"


"Please never call me that."


"Right." She turned to Emma. "So, what about you?"


"My name's Emma Barnes. I was one of the ones that caused Taylor to end up in that locker." She didn't 'cause me to end up in that locker'. She pushed me in! "And, uh, Taylor's power affected me similar to how it affected you. Except Taylor also used to be my best friend." Emma suddenly looked like she was about to cry.


"Uh, sorry." Chatterbox said. She sat there for a bit, trying to be patient, but eventually she blurted out, "So, what's your power?"


Emma looked up, and said "I ask questions, and people have to answer them." She went back to looking down. I couldn't really tell if she was crying or not.


Carla sat still for a bit longer still waiting for Emma to cheer up, before asking "So, what are your cape names?"


"Well, she's Interrogator." I said, gesturing toward Emma. "I haven't decided on mine. I was initially thinking about Redeemer, since the first thing I did was supposed to be convincing you to switch sides, but that didn't work out quite like I had planned. I'm now thinking about something related to motivation or inspiration, as those are basically the primary uses of my power on the battlefield."


"Well," Carlos spoke up, "You have until tomorrow to decide, as that's when your actual first patrol will be."


I went home, trying to think of a name.


\-\-\-


Author's Note: I need to find a better name for Taylor, so if you have ideas, tell me. I also need to come up with a new name for Brian, as Grue is very much a villainous name, so give me suggestions for that as well. Also, sorry about the update taking so long. I've been wasting time reading other Worm fanfiction as opposed to writing my own.

# My Plans for Later

When I decided to stop writing this fanfiction, I posted a list of my plans for how it would continue. Here they are:

Trickster kidnaps Panacea in hopes of using her to heal Noelle during the times when her power is disabled while Chatterbox is ranting. Panacea breaks, and becomes an S-Class threat. Then I realized this story has nothing to do with the main character, and doesn't even make much sense. Also, I forget if I already posted this, but Grue becomes a Ward named Blackout, and Taylor changes her cape name to Speaker.
