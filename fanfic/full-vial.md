# Full Vial

Full Vial was probably my most ambitious fanfiction. I had started actually having beta readers read it, to make sure it would be good. Turns out, that just made me realize I wasn't good enough to write something with such an ambitious premise, which is why I ended up giving up after only 2 chapters. I may actually continue it from the first chapter, which was fairly good, but I probably won't. Also, I'm including author's notes here since they show a bit of my thought process while writing this. You can read it in the form I originally posted it on Spacebattles [here](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/full-vial-worm-au.784246/) and on Sufficient Velocity [here](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/full-vial-worm-au.57378/# post-12974320).

# Prologue

So, I'm not very good at writing well established characters. This has lead to me having problems writing my other two stories, as in Cetacean, I'm currently dealing with Taylor, and in Banter, Taylor and Emma are two of the main characters. So, I figured that this story would actually go a lot better than the other two, since it's mostly about characters with a small amount of characterization.

This story was actually the first idea I came up with for Worm fanfiction, but I decided to figure out how to write better for a bit before I started it. I also wanted to make sure no one else had written something with a similar premise. Now, I'm ready to post this. The premise is basically that Krouse decided to only take a half vial to make sure that Noelle could get a full vial, and Krouse ends up with the power that Wildbow described as an S-Class version of Trickster.

The first bit will be mostly copied over from 17.6(since everything is in almost the exact same position), and is pretty short, so I'll just put it here as a prologue, and not threadmark it.

\-\-\-

I was being woken up in the hospital by Krouse. How did he get in here. Well, it was nice to see someone who I knew anyways. I smiled.


He smiled back. “You’re finally awake.”


“Morphine helped. Hurt too much to even open my eyes, before.”


“Sorry.”


“Hey, Krouse… things are pretty fucked, aren’t they?”


“Yeah,” he said. He smiled a little. “So you caught some of what we were talking about?”


I nodded slowly. I wasn't sure how much of what I had dreamed was real, but I was in this hospital, so it was likely that we at least got attacked by the Simurgh.


“Yeah, things are supremely fucked,” he said.


I nodded a little. “I’m due for another surgery. They gave me one short one, and now they’re replacing my blood, see?”


“I see,” he said, eyeing the blood bags.


“…I kind of wish we’d done more boyfriend and girlfriend stuff,” I said. “Sorry.”


“Don’t need to apologize. You did what you had to.”


“I could die,” I said. I was scared, but not scared enough. Must be shock, or maybe the painkillers. “They’re cutting too much out, and they can’t wait any longer, but my condition’s bad, so I could die on the table.”


“You’re not going to die.”


“And even if I live, I’m gonna be ugly. Nice big plastic plug in my belly, with a bag of shit attached. Which is really ironic, you don’t even know…” I trailed off.


“I sort of figured it out,” he said.


I nodded. “Big scars, bag of shit. Is why I wish we’d done more, before. Won’t be any good to look at, after.”


“I don’t care about scars. But it doesn’t matter anyways. You’re not going to die, and you won’t have scars. Or a colostomy bag.”


What?


He asked, “You catch any of what we were talking about? Back at the house?”


“Only some. Um. I can’t distinguish the reality from the delirium dreams.”


“I suspect the delirium dreams made a little more sense, if that helps,” he said.


He set the canister down on the short table beside the bed.


“What’s that?” My eyes widened. “That wasn’t a dream, then. Krouse, no.”


“Yes. You’re going to take this, and it’ll help. You’ll live, and you won’t need surgery. Then I’ll get you out of here, and we’ll go home. Somehow.”


“I don’t- no, Krouse. People were saying… They were scared. This… this isn’t some minor thing.”


“No. It’s big. It’s huge.”


“There were only six,” I said. “And there’s seven of us.”


“You deserve special treatment, after what you’ve been through, so I only took half a bottle myself. One of the others will only get half, but my power turned out fine, so theirs will too, probably."


"Couldn't I take the other half?"


"I'm not sure if half would be enough to heal you. And, as I said, you deserve special treatment."


“No, Krouse. I… there’s too many things, too many warnings, and stuff you guys were saying about poison-“


I could hear footsteps in the hall, and Krouse tensed up. "Well, you better make up your mind fast."


I figured that anything that vial could do to me would be better than this. "I… guess I don't have much of a choice."


He helped me pour the contents of the vial into my mouth. At first, it was nothing. And then, I screamed.

# Chapter 1

This is the actual Chapter 1. However, unless you literally just read 17.6 of Worm, you should still read the Prologue above.

\-\-\-

I woke up, and saw Krouse. I heard an alarm. Then, I saw the man who had just hit Krouse with a gun. Then, the man was gone, and where he had been standing, the floor had bits of flesh sticking out of it. Did Krouse just kill someone with his power? Fuse him with the floor? That's terrifying.


I then remembered the reason I had just passed out, and been in pain. I had drunk that vial, and it had healed me completely. I wondered what my power was. I searched in my mind for some button or display, and I found something.


I could push out of my body with my power. I didn't know what I was pushing out, but I needed to test it. I sat up, and pushed out through my hand, which I had pointed away from Krouse. However, I needed to push something out. No, someone. I could feel the list of people I could push out. There was me, there was Krouse, and there was the man that Krouse had killed. I decided my safest option was to push out the man that Krouse had killed.


I pushed, and there was a lump on my arm. It grew, and popped off. It started changing shape. It became the shape of a man. A naked man. A naked man that was the size of my hand. That also looked exactly like the man that Krouse had killed.


"Your power. It's creating people?" he asked.


"Yeah, people that I've seen." Wow. That was stronger than any power I'd ever heard of. Was this kind of power normal on this other earth? I touched the clone, and absorbed him back into me. "That was the man that you killed."


"Right. I was a bit dazed, so my power activated itself. It just sent him into the floor."


"A power activating itself sounds dangerous, especially if it kills people."


"Nah, I just need to be wary."


"You just murdered someone."


"My power just murdered someone. I'll learn to control it. However, there is the problem that more people are on their way here. We need to get out. You should get dressed."


I managed to get up, and got on my clothes. Then, a section of the hospital wall was missing, and the ground had several rocky spikes coming out of it. Krouse started heading out, and gestured for me to follow him. As we made our way toward the car he stole, I noticed how much chaos was going on. There were PRT vans and capes, here to deal with the Simurgh.


I then thought about Krouse's power. He just killed someone in an instant. Was there a range limit? A recharge? I felt like I should know the details. "Hey, Krouse. What's your power, exactly?"


"I can swap things that I can see. That guy I killed? Swapped him with the floor. That hole in the wall? Swapped it with the floor. I can swap things that aren't the floor too, but the floor tends to be convenient."


"Do you have any limits to your powers?"


"No, unless you count the fact that my power uses itself when I'm off guard."


We had got to the car, and were getting it. "So that wasn't the only time?"


"Nah, it nearly killed Cody. I managed to move my head at the last second to destroy a lamp instead."


I was shocked. "You nearly killed Cody!?"


"No, my power nearly killed Cody. I actually saved Cody, even if he didn't deserve it."


"Your power is part of you!"


"Yeah, I'll get it under control." As he said that, a stop sign suddenly had bits of mailbox sticking out of it, and a nearby mailbox had bits of stop sign.


"That didn't look like it was under control."


"Yeah, I'm working on it."


"Maybe I should stop talking, and let you focus on not causing that to happen to this car."


"Sounds good." He continued driving, and I didn't notice any other uses of his power.


After a few minutes, Krouse said, "Huh. Cody got himself some powers, and also made the others get powers too. Says it was to make sure he could defend themselves against me."


I tried to refrain from talking, but I couldn't help but ask, "How do you kown that?"


"Oh, right. My power came with knowledge of everything within a mile of me."


"What!? Why didn't you tell me that?"


"Uh, it didn't seem important. I mean, the stuff going on here is pretty easy to know. Everyone is just going crazy."


Then a bird fell from the sky, with bits of a tree in it. I stopped talking.


Pretty quickly, we got to the house we had been staying in. As we walked up to the door, I was suddenly inside, being carried by Cody. "What!?"


"Krouse nearly killed you. His power's unstable," Cody said angrily, setting my down. Then, I noticed that the door had been fused with a part of the roof.


"Oh." That wasn't good. He wasn't getting his power under control, his power was getting him more under control. And apparently what his power wanted was to swap everything and everyone.


Krouse swapped the mess of the door with a window, and walked in. Then, a miniature sun burnt a hole in the back of the house, and suddenly all of us were launching out of the house. We were all picked up by some kind of dragon that put us onto its back. "What just happened!?" I yelled.


"It was our plan for if you somehow managed to survive being around Krouse long enough to get back here," Mars explained. "Cody was sure he'd kill you, and he nearly did. I'm not sure if we could have saved you without him."


"Uh, what's with the dragon!?" I screamed. Today had lots of screaming.


"This is Jess, or more specifically, my power," The dragon said. I noticed that Jess was asleep on the dragon's back. "I can make projections of creatures as I sleep. I'm glad I made a flying one, since we probably couldn't have made it out fast enough without it."


"Wait, so how did you survive that long near Krouse? He tried to kill me seconds after he drank that vial," Cody asked.


"Uh, I think he tried really hard not to kill me. He did kill at least one person in the hospital, if not more while he broke in. He also killed a bird while driving back."


"Ah. So what is his power, other than randomly trying to kill people?" Cody asked.


"He can swap things that he sees, and is aware of everything within a mile of him."


"And this 'swapping' is what he does that causes whatever happened to that door, and the lamp?" Mars asked.


"Yeah."


"Wow. This city is even more doomed than if it just had the Simurgh," Luke said.


"Yeah." I realized I still didn't know who did the thing with the miniature sun, and who launched us out of the house. I also don't know how Cody got me into the house. I decided to ask them what their powers were.


Luke could speed things up, Mars could create suns, and Cody could send things back in time. Oliver's power was combining things like Krouse, but it was very structured and limited, unlike Krouse. It seems like getting half the vial made Oliver's power unusually restricted, while it made Krouse's unusually unrestricted.


"So, we all have powers then," I said. "What do we do now?"

# Chapter 2

I got a bit distracted for a week, but I finally finished the second chapter! This chapter was beta read by Vilheim, who helped a lot with editing.


\-\-\-


"We need to find a way home," Mars said, "but we can't do that alone. We should tell the Protectorate about our situation."


"There are so many problems with that plan," Cody scoffed. "Firstly, where? Madison is gone, and I doubt the rest of Wisconsin is safe with Krouse around."


"I think the best place to show up would probably be Brockton Bay," Jess said, "and with my power, traveling long distances is no problem."


Cody continued as if Jess had said nothing, "Secondly, we illegally got here from Earth Aleph, and illegally left the Simurgh quarantine. They'd just imprison us."


"Well, do you have any better ideas?" Mars asked.


"Yes, actually. We could become villains. No need to hide anything then, and we could negotiate with more people to get back home."


"No!" Yelled the rest of us. Except Luke, who just had a disapproving expression on his face.


"Fine. You can all get yourselves into prison, but I'm gonna leave."


"You're an asshole anyways,." Jess grunted, which was pretty intimidating considering that she was a giant dragon.


"Well, I think I have another plan,." I said, "We could tell them some of the truth. We could say we got mysteriously teleported here from Earth Aleph and got powers, but not mention the Simurgh or Krouse."


"Sounds like a good compromise to me,." Luke said.


"Not to me," Cody retorted, "I'd rather tell them everything than lie to the most powerful organization in the country."


"Yeah, I agree with Cody here.," Jess said.


"So, we've decided. We'll tell them everything.," Mars said. I wasn't particularly attached to my plan, and Jess probably knew better than me.


"Sounds like a plan.," I said.


"I'm already heading toward Brockton Bay," Jess said, "so we'll hopefully be there soon."


"Why not just go to Chicago?" I asked. "It's a lot closer." I pointed forward at where I could see a city in the distance that I assumed was Chicago based on its size.


"Brockton Bay has a bit of a villain problem, and I'm pretty sure it's the place most in need of heroes," Jess responded. "Also, Chicago is too close to Krouse, and I feel like he might be looking for us."


"Ah," I said. I decided to watch the clouds for a bit. We were still heading up, so we would be passing through through them any minute now. It was getting colder pretty fast, but people would see us if we weren't above the clouds.


Once we were above the clouds, I decided it was as good a time as any to test my power. I pushed out a little clone of myself through the side of my leg. I found that if I kept pushing, she got bigger. I stopped pushing when she was about a foot tall, and then touched her to see if I could do more than just absorb her.


Turned out, I could do a lot more than just absorb her. I noticed that even without touching her, I could tell what she was thinking, and give her orders telepathically. When I touched her, I realized a whole new aspect of my powers.


"Testing your power?" Mars asked.


"Yeah, I just realized I can alter biology. Only my own biology, and my clone's biology, but that's still notable. I also noticed that I can telepathically communicate with my clone. Now, I'm going to see if I can manage multiple clones, as well as how clones of different people work. Anyone willing to let me clone them?" I asked.


"You can clone me, I guess." Luke said.


I began pushing him out, and kept the clone at only a few inches. Sure enough, I could sense his thoughts and alter his biology. I wonder if he could use powers. "Hey, clone-Luke, can you use your powers?" I asked. I could've just used telepathy, but decided the others should also know what I could do.


A tiny, high pitched voice that I realized was the clone responded, "Yeah, but only barely. Instead of bringing things up to bullet speed, I can only set things at a speed that might be achieved by pushing them."


"Woah, he can talk?" Luke asked. Then he looked uneasy. "Is he, uh, sentient?"


"I think he's just an extension of me." I said. I then realized something. He remembered getting powers, or at least remembered having them. "Uh clone-Luke, do you remember being Luke?"


"Yeah! I have all of his memories!" That was huge. He was referring to Luke as a separate person, despite having the same memories, but that was probably due to whatever stopped him from freaking out once he realized he was just a clone.


"Clone-me, do you have powers?" I asked. If she could make more clones herself, that would be great.


"Not all of them." She said in a voice slightly less high pitched than clone-Luke, "I can still alter my bi-biology." She had trouble saying that word. Decreased intelligence? Voice not working at a smaller size? I'd have to investigate. "I think I can alter other clones too, but I can't create any more clones."


"That's good," Jess said, "because if you could, there might be some problematic parallels to Nilbog. Honestly, you're pretty close to him already, so you should probably avoid doing anything like him."


"Uh, who is Nilbog?" Luke asked.


"He can create life forms that can self-replicate, and he took over and killed an entire city," Jess responded quickly.


"Ah. I can see the parallels." I said, "So, no self replication, and no clones getting pregnant, which I'm actually pretty sure might be possible."


Everyone was awkwardly staring at me, except Jess, who was too busy being a dragon. Then, they looked at the clones. "You should probably get them clothes," Mars said.


"Yeah," I responded. There was an awkward silence as I realized how embarrassing this was. Well, it was silent except for the air rushing around us. "Wait, let me try something." I touched the clones, and tried to grow their skin into the shape of clothes, and tried to replicate the texture. It looked fine, but was pretty gross if you thought about it.


"That didn't help." Mars looked like she was about to throw up. Skin slowly morphing into clothing looked gross, apparently.


"Just… try not to think about it," I said. There was an awkward pause before I said, "Back to power testing!"


After a bit of testing, I found that I didn't seem to have a limit on the number of clones I could control, but all the matter that created the clones came from me; for every clone I created, I got smaller.


"We need hero names." I said as I absorbed my clones, going back to my normal size. "And we need them quick."


"I can be Ballistic." Luke said. "Pretty straightforward."


"Well, for me, I was thinking Rhea, since she's the mother of the gods in Greek mythology." I said.


Cody grinned. "Well, I was thinking of being Kronos, so..."


"No," I responded sharply.


"Fine. I can be Perdition."


"We're supposed to be heroes!" Jess roared.


"Eh, I'd rather be a vigilante. And it's either that or Kronos."


"Fine. Not many people will know what it means anyways," Jess grumbled. "If we're going with biblical stuff, I guess I can be Genesis."


"I can't really think of anything," Mars said.


"Me neither," Oliver mumbled.


"Well, Mars dances and makes suns," Luke said, "So how about Sundancer?"


"I guess that's fine," she responded.


"As for Oliver, we don't know much about his power, but it doesn't seem like something to use mid-battle."


"Yeah, kinda like a tinker," Jess said. "I think that Blacksmith can be a good name for him."


"Sure," he mumbled.


A few minutes later, we saw the skyline of Brockton Bay begin to emerge.
