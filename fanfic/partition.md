# Partition

When I decided to move on to writing original stories, I decided to start another Worm Fanfiction with the intention of actually being good, before I realized that if I wanted to write original stories, I should probably focus all my energy on them. Partition was originally posted on Spacebattles [here](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/partition-worm-au-altpower.889513/).

# Chapter 1

I found a nice little corner in a forgotten alleyway. A place like that was probably the safest place I could be. I sat down, eyes toward the alley to make sure no one was watching, and I began charging my power. As this happened, I was still able to move, but any movement would waste all the energy I had charged up. However, once I activated my power, I wouldn't even have the luxury of being able to move.

After a minute, I was ready, and activated my power. As I did this, it felt like my limbs had separated from themselves. I moved, and rather than my limbs moving, an invisible projection that looked nearly exactly like me moved. It was unnerving at first, but after about a month of practice, I was getting used to it. Right now, it was invisible, and I couldn't feel through its senses. However, I knew it was there, because I could move it.

I began moving the projection out of the alley I had hidden myself in. Once it was out, and I could no longer see where it was moving through my own eyes, I began putting more of the energy my power had created into it. As this energy entered the projection, it became more tangible, to both me and others. I couldn't see it with my own eyes, but I knew from experience that it was now visible as a hazy form of myself. As well as this, I became able to see through with it.The vision was incredibly blurry, but it was enough for it to keep moving.

Now that I had a projection up, I was no longer able to move my original body. This was why I had put it in a secluded alleyway. I was completely vulnerable to attack, and I had no way to defend myself unless I got my projection back here. Fortunately, my projection was fast.

The projection began leaping through the streets amazingly fast, with its nearly incorporeal form riding in the wind. I was patrolling through the streets faster than any hero who didn't have super speed or flight. It was unfortunate I probably wouldn't be able to use that ability in battles, since my projections couldn't impact the physical world in this state. But still, it was far from useless.

Before I saw anything, I heard something. In between the periodic footsteps of my projection, I heard a distant noise that might have been speech. It could have just been a raccoon, so I ran a bit closer to the sound to check. Once I got nearby, I saw two people, as well as three larger four legged figures near them. I hid behind a nearby wall and poured some more energy into my projection so I could see and hear better.

"Give me your fucking wallet!" I heard a voice say. I looked around the corner, and there was someone with a dog mask intimidating a man. Around her were some weird giant lizard things, pacing around the two, growling. Given the mask, maybe they were supposed to be dogs. Who was this cape? I'd researched all the capes of the major gangs in the city, and there weren't any that had a dog theme, unless you counted Hookwolf. And this obviously wasn't Hookwolf.

"N-No!" the man stuttered. He clearly was trying to be brave in the face of being mugged, but also obviously didn't have any plan for if he had to fight. Good thing I was here.

"Attack," the dog-masked person commanded her monsters, pointing toward the man. It was time for me to strike. I put the rest of my energy into my projection, and emerged from behind the wall, jumping toward the scene.

"The fuck?" the cape growled. One of the creatures rushed forward to bite the man, and I kicked its head out of the way with my projection's increased strength. A fight meant my projection could be destroyed, and any more energy put into this projection wouldn't be worth the effort since it already had enough energy, so I began preparing another projection as backup.

A different dog-thing than the one I had kicked bit my projection's leg, and dents appeared in it. It didn't hurt, since my projections couldn't feel pain, but it severely weakened my it, and I could feel that. I shoved the attacking creature away a bit with my hands, but the leg was still pretty badly hurt. I wouldn't be moving nearly as fast, or doing any kicking with that leg, or the other leg for that matter, since I would need the injured leg for support. I crouched down so I could better counter any attacks with my arms, which were still free.

A third creature jumped to lunge at my projection, and I blocked with both arms. I needed more stability to block, so I started to step back with one leg to brace myself better, forgetting about the injury in my leg. The projection collapsed to the floor, leg folded in half, with the monster dog biting at its face. My projection's head was actually the least vital part of my projections, since I didn't even need it to see or hear; it was just cosmetic. However, biting at its face necessitated stepping on the rest of my projection's body, rendering it immobile. I could dissipate it, but I didn't since it could serve as a distraction while I waited for my second one.

The second projection, like the first, was created in the alley where my own body was, so it would take a while for it to make it to the fight. I hadn't yet put any energy to it, since I now knew the path and could make it to the fight without having to see. The increased speed made it so I didn't have to risk the cape going from attacking my projection back to mugging that man.

Once I got to the scene, I put in as much energy as I could to see how the scene had changed, and I saw that the man was running away. I just had to keep the mugger occupied long enough for him to make it to safety. Once I saw that, I looked at the monster dogs, and watched them mauling my first projection to pieces. Fortunately, they hadn't yet seen my second projection, so I removed some energy from my second projection so it could run over and touch my first one without being noticed. Once they touched, the first projection disappeared, and the second one gained some of its energy, appearing to the monster dogs and the cape.

I quickly had it jump backward, to avoid the monster dogs' attacks. I couldn't jump over the dogs to get to the cape herself because they were pretty large, but I also couldn't go around the monster dogs either, since the three of them were blocking the entire alleyway. That meant I had to try to go through them.

I looked for an angle where the monster dogs didn't have any of their teeth, claws, or spikes, withdrew as much energy as I could from my projection, and jumped through as fast as I could. When I put energy back into the projection, I felt weakness in my ankles. Sure enough, there were dents all over my legs, and a few elsewhere where my projection passed through the dogs. They didn't hurt, but they certainly reduced my strength. So, I probably couldn't pull off a move like that again. However, I had made it to the controller of the monster dogs, and I grabbed her by the arm.

The monster dogs lunged at me, and I tried to dash away. However, the extra weight of holding another person combined with the ankle injuries meant I didn't go nearly as fast as I normally would, and the creature's claws caught me by the foot. I kept my grip on the cape's arm, keeping her restrained even while my feet were pinned by her monster dog.

I saw a gold figure approach into the alleyway behind the monster dogs. My first thought was Scion, but it obviously wasn't him. It was just the youngest member of the city's Protectorate, Triumph. The man must have called the PRT when he escaped.

Triumph let out a long loud yell, and I could see the air distort around it as the dogs were knocked off me, and against the wall. The dog cape yelled "Fuck you!" but she couldn't move to stop him due to my projection's grip on her. Triumph ran to the recovering forms of the dogs, and yelled again as they started tried to make their way toward me and their master. This yell was a bit louder, and the dogs didn't look keen on trying to stop him again. Triumph's two screams felt like they should have hurt my ears, but my projection's hearing was just as good as ever.

The dogs now being off me meant my projection could move, and thus couldn't be dissipated even if I wanted to. However, I figured I would hold on at least until Triumph had left.

Triumph walked quickly over to the cape, and grabbed her, and said, "You can let go." I did so. Triumph also had boosted strength, and was currently uninjured, unlike my projection. The dog cape kept thrashing and attempting to escape, but couldn't due to being surrounded by two capes with enhanced strength, and her just having the strength of a very fit normal human.

Triumph got out a pair of handcuffs, and cuffed her after some struggling. By the time he managed to get them on her, she was mainly just growling, though she was still trying to pull her hands out of the handcuffs, unsuccessfully. Triumph kept holding on to her, but he turned toward my projection. "Who are you?" He asked.

I put my fingers in an X over the bandana covering my mouth. I had found that my projections were unable to talk, despite looking nearly human.

"Can't talk?" he asked.

I nodded.

"Looks like we'll have to do twenty questions on the way to the hospital," he said, with a small chuckle. I began shaking my head.

"What? No going to the hospital? But you look pretty badly hurt. Why not?"

I gestured toward the dents on my body, and then gave an "ok" sign. I hoped that would get the message across.

"The injuries are okay?" I nodded. "Are you sure?" I nodded. "Well, then I suppose I can take Hellhound to the PRT while I ask questions," he said. "Can you walk?"

I got up, and began limping toward him. While I did that, Hellhound yelled something about a bitch, probably referring to me. We both ignored her.

"Hm, not really," he said. "Well, then it probably wouldn't be smart to try to bring you along while I take her to be detained. Do you want to be a hero?" he asked.

I nodded.

"Well, then you should consider joining the Wards. They..." I started shaking my head vigorously as soon as he said "Wards." I had considered my options, and decided solidly against joining them. Wards weren't allowed to fight any dangerous supervillains, that is to say, they weren't allowed to actually make any difference. I didn't want that. Along with that, there were a bunch of teenagers in the Wards, and my experiences with other teenagers have been mildly annoying at best and nearly fatal at worst. No joining the Wards.

"Are you sure?" he asked. I nodded decisively.

"Well, I urge you to reconsider. The Wards are the best place for young heroes to be! I would know," he said.

I continued shaking my head. "Why not? If you're worried about it being awkward, it's not like that! The Wards are all friendly with each other, and they'll see you as just as much of a hero as you see them."

He looked confused after I kept shaking my head, and then continued. "Are you worried about not being allowed to go after larger targets?" He guessed.

I nodded. "Well, it isn't really that simple." I knew it wasn't. That didn't change my decision. "Being a solo vigilante is incredibly dangerous, especially when you're just a kid. Any hero who wants to be safe should join a team, and the Wards are your best option here. And it isn't like we let the more powerful threats go unaddressed, it's just that the adults handle them, not the kids." Bullshit. Kaiser and Lung had been going strong for who knows how long.

I shook my head. He seemed to misinterpret that as me reiterating my desire to not join the Wards. "Still no? Well, don't be afraid to call us whenever. We'd be glad to have you if you ever changed your mind!" He waved as he began dragging Hellhound away. I waved as well, turned my projection incorporeal, and began float-limping my way back to my body.

Once my projection made its way back to the alleyway I had been sitting in the corner of, it touched my body and dissipated, allowing me to move my body again. As soon as I got up, all of my power's energy went away, and I began walking back home.

I'd say that was a successful first night out. I sort of helped a Protectorate hero arrest a villain. Even if I'd never heard of that villain. There were lots of villains in Brockton Bay, and I couldn't know about all of them.

I got home, and quietly opened the door to get inside. I couldn't wake up my dad both because it was 3 in the morning, and because he didn't know I was a cape. I made my way up to my room, and took off my costume. Well, calling it a costume was generous. It was just a pair of thick black skintight leggings, a tight black sweater, tennis shoes, and a bandana around my face. I had considered covering my whole face, since my projections didn't need my eyes unobscured to see, but had decided against it.

Once I was out of my costume and into my pajamas, I decided to quickly look up Hellhound, to see who I had helped detain.

Apparently her name was Rachel Lindt, and she had no secret identity. She was a homeless independent villain who had been in a lot of skirmishes over the past two years, but never anything big. She had been in Brockton Bay for the past few months due to the fact that the authorities didn't care about a single independent villain committing petty theft, so she only had to worry about other villains, who were too busy fighting each other. I saw a large warning telling people not to engage with her due to her being very aggressive. I had clearly not followed that rule, but it had helped get her captured, so I figured it was worth it. She had apparently murdered people before, so it was possible that I had even saved lives by making sure she got captured.

Satisfied with the information I had gained, I shut off my computer, got in bed, and went to sleep feeling happy with myself for the first time in probably a year.
