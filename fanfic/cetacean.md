# Cetacean

Most of the chapters in Cetacean were written very quickly when inspiration struck, and posted without beta readers. This resulted in the mess you will see. The author's notes are included, as they are somewhat part of that mess. You can read it in the form I originally posted it on Spacebattles [here](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cetacean-worm-au-and-maybe-si.780286/# post-60510397) and on Sufficient Velocity [here](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/cetacean-worm-au-and-maybe-si.57376/# post-12974303).

# Chapter 1

I just got bored and wrote almost 2k words of worm fanfiction. This one has a main character that's based on a minor character in an original story I'm writing, and that minor character is based on me. So I guess it's a Self Insert? Idk. I'm not sure if this fanfiction is any good, but I'll likely keep updating it since it's a lot of fun to write.


\-\-\-


Sea urchins are stupid. I mean, look at them! They're like the size of my hand! I thought stepping on one would be really annoying, but not this. Either that, or I'm a wimp. Well, either way, I'm having trouble controlling my body now. I also think I'm drowning. This water is barely deeper than I am tall! This is so unfair.


Screaming is stupid. I mean, when is it ever a good idea? If you scream, and there are, I dunno, sharks nearby… Er, sharks can't hear, right? Eh, that's not even the point. The point is that screaming causes drowning when underwater.


Drowning is stupid. I mean, uh, these thoughts are getting repetitive. The water is rapidly going down my throat, no time to indulge useless patterns! Wait, I'd been here for like, 30 seconds. Shouldn't the water be in my lungs by now? Oh right, time slows down when you're in excruciating pain.


Okay, water going down my throat. That is something I should stop. Very bad. Can I, like, push the water out?


Pew! Pew!


I can shoot the water out apparently. I need to do that faster


PewPewPewPewPewPewPew


Okay, I'm no longer drowning. I think. I honestly can't tell the difference, other than the fact that I no longer feel water in my throat. However, I still have the problem that I can't breathe. Wait, I haven't breathed for a few minutes! I guess the adrenaline is causing that? Or what? I should still swim to the surface.


I can't move my body. Or maybe I can, but only really slowly. That sucks. What if…


Shwoosh! Shwoosh!


Woah, too fast. I guess that pewpewpew thing is much stronger when not in my throat. At least I'm now above water, even if I caused a huge splash. Er, why is that splash so slow? Wait, I move in slow motion, splashes are in slow motion…


I got the power to experience time slowly! Like, really slowly. I guess that explains the whole not drowning thing. So if I got powers, is that why I can push water? Hydrokinesis is cool I guess. Not as cool as being able to think super fast.


Okay, I need to orient myself. I'm currently just everywhere, so my feet go down, and my head goes up, and now I need to head back to the beach. Because, like, I still had a sea urchin sting. I couldn't exactly keep snorkeling.

ShwooshShwooshSwooshShwooshShwooshSwooshSwoosh


Even with my Hydrokinesis, the journey back to the beach was slow. And despite still having a snorkel mask on, I couldn't see any fish. I must have scared them all off with that splash. Also, I take back what I said about thinking super fast being cool. Boredom is the worst.


ShwooshShwooshSwooshShwooshShwooshSwooshSwoosh


I've tried counting in my head, and comparing it to how I move to find out how fast I think. Turns out, the answer is about sixty times as fast as normal. I mean, that's ridiculous, but also really boring. Like, one minute of boredom was now a full hour!


ShwooshShwooshSwooshShwooshShwooshSwooshSwoosh


People were noticing me, and staring. Whatever. I'd explain that I had powers. I never liked the idea of secret identities, but I understood why some people needed them. I didn't need one, so this was fine.


ShwooshShwooshSwooshShwooshShwooshSwooshSwoosh


Woah, what is that? It's like, a long silver thing. Looks like a flying fish, but it doesn't have enough fins. But it's jumping out of the water, so that's the only thing that made sense. Maybe it was a baby dolphin? Still too many fins. Baby whale? I dunno, it's dolphin colored. I'll just say it's a baby cetacean. Partially because that is accurate, but mostly because cetaceans are cool. Also cetacean is a cool word. Maybe that could be my cape name? Cape names are supposed to sound cool, so Cetacean would be great!


ShwooshShwooshSwooshShwooshShwooshSwooshSwoosh


I've realized that I can make water float with my power, but not too much. I think I have a limit on how much water I control. So I'd go slower if I messed around with floating water, but it was worth it to get rid of the boredom.


ShwooshShwooshSwooshShwooshShwooshSwooshSwoosh


I've found that I can shape the water I control in any way. I've been messing around trying to create a human body, because that would be cool. Unfortunately, it would have to be a small human body, or a hollow one. I think the maximum amount of water I control is roughly equal to the mass of a human body.


ShwooshShwooshSwooshShwooshShwooshSwooshSwoosh


I can use my power to sense fish! More ways to relieve boredom! I couldn't see the pretty colors, but I could sense the exact shape, and compare different fish. I wonder if I could do the same thing, but with a sort of spread out field of water, to sense humans.


ShwooshShwooshSwooshShwooshShwooshSwooshSwoosh


I feel like using the people at the beach as test subjects would be immoral, so I tested my idea on birds. The result is a sort of blurry idea of what was happening. It wasn't as cool as looking at fish, but it's still cool.


ShwooshShwooshSwooshShwooshShwooshSwooshSwoosh


I just realized my method of sensing things is kind of like echolocation. Both were colorblind, both were kinda blurry, and both could be used as a replacement for sight! Another reason to name myself Cetacean!


ShwooshShwooshSwooshShwooshShwooshSwooshSwoosh


Finally! At the beach! My human body experiment was still floating over the ocean, which confirmed that my range was very long. You know, I should test that.


Fwoosh!


I can still sense that little orb of water I just sent out, even though it was rapidly going away from me! I feel like my range is probably infinite, so I can put that orb back in the ocean.


Plop!


There are my parents. I just realized I don't know how to talk 60 times slower. Good thing I knew phonetics. I could just make each sound one by one for a few seconds. I didn't want to spend too much time talking, so I just pointed at my foot.


"S… ea… Ur… ch… i… n…" I said, in what was probably an odd voice. I then pointed at my head. "Po… w… er… s…"


My mom's face turned from confusion to confusion with a touch of worry. I found listening hard, but possible. I still couldn't make out her tone. "Wh… a… t?" Oh. Just one word. Yeah, I figure that's a reasonable response.


"N… ee… d h… o… s… pi… ta… l…" I was noticing my foot's pain again. Sand probably wasn't good for sea urchin poison. I realized how tired I was, so I lied down on the sand, and focused completely on the fish and my human body experiment. I think my parents thought I was asleep.


Blah. Blah. Blah.


I think I was being carried. I didn't bother to listen to what they were saying. I was basically asleep, with my powers making up my dreams.


BlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlah


I was noticing I could feel the vibrations of sound in my water. I recreated the vibrations quietly in my ear at 60 times speed, and sure enough, I could hear wherever my water was. It was just the sounds of the ocean, but I could probably listen to the noise.


"She didn't pass out. She's not even asleep." Right. I was in a hospital. My parents were probably extra worried about the fact that I appeared to pass out.


"Really? Because she just collapsed after saying she needed a hospital in this really weird voice."


"Did she say anything else?"


"She said that she saw an urchin, and also said something about powers." Couldn't she see my pointing at my foot, and then my head.


I started talking. "Sea urchin foot sting. Got powers. Powers mess with voice, and hydrokinesis." Hydrokinesis is a hard word to say, but it was faster to say than "control water" and it sounded cooler.


"Mess with voice? Why would hydrokinesis mess with voice?" The voice I didn't recognize, who I assumed was a doctor, said.


"Brain fast. Body slow." I said.


"I'm still confused."


"Sea urchin sting." The sea urchin sting was far more important than powers.


And it was too late. He was already calling the PRT. Back to sleep I go!


BlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlah


Okay, my foot was feeling stuff. I guess they finally got to doing the thing I went here for. Having the pain go away was so nice. "Thank… you…" I decided to show my power by getting some water from the ocean with my human shaped thing, and sending it over to me. I shaped the water in to the words "Thank you!" To display the gratitude I could no longer display with the tone of my voice. I smiled, and made some of my extra water into a cartoon happy face.


The doctor called the PRT again, now seeing my power. I realized he was talking about getting me into the Honolulu Wards, so I said "On vacation. Live near Brockton Bay." His face looked a bit disappointed, but he told the PRT. I guess I'm joining the Brockton Bay Wards now. That's pretty awesome! However, our family vacation was being cut short, based on what I heard my parents saying. That makes sense, but I was really looking forward to this vacation, and now I was missing most of it. Oh well. I had powers! And boredom!


BlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlah


The plane flight home was fun. I made shapes with the water in the clouds out the windows, and the other kids on the plane were entertained. I hope this wasn't against the law or anything, because it was really fun.


I had my human body experiment follow the plane to Brockton Bay, as having it in Hawaii is impractical. As fun as it was, I doubted it would be useful to create a human body as a member of the Wards. Maybe I could create another hero identity where I had more freedom, not being restricted by being in the Wards? That sounded like it could work.


I was getting better at dealing with boredom, and talking. I still couldn't make my voice have a tone, but I could talk and listen pretty normally. After we got home and slept, the first thing we did the next morning was go to the PRT and sign up as a Ward.


SignSignSignSignSignSignSign


Signing things is boring. However, meeting the other Wards was… also boring.


BlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlah


Kid Win, or Chris, was the only one anything like me. Clockblocker/Dennis seemed pretty cool too, but the others were just too serious. Or they were Shadow Stalker/Sophia. Turns out, even heroes have a few bullies.


BlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlah


I decided not to say the full extent of my faster thought. I just said I thought faster, not that it was 60 times faster. The most interesting part of meeting with the PRT was them testing my powers, and classifying them. I was a Thinker 2 and a Blaster/Shaker 3 with a subrating of Mover 1. Overall quite weak powers, but mainly because I wasn't very good at showing my powers off, and kind of didn't want to. If I was too powerful, I would have people talking to me a lot. I don't like talking.


BlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlah


I'm a hero now! My first patrol is tomorrow! Once that happens, I'll be like, officially a hero! Stopping crime, making the world a better place, you know, all that awesome stuff. And I have an awesome power. Pretty good for an early Christmas present.

# Chapter 2

I just checked on the google doc where I keep this, and apparently I wrote another thousand words. So here's another chapter.


\-\-\-


Apparently the people who make costumes get a break around Christmas. So, since I became a Ward on the day before Christmas Eve, I wasn't getting my costume for a while. I had come up with a costume idea for when they were ready though. It looked like a silly kids dolphin halloween costume. I knew it was cheezy and probably stupid, but I liked it. Due to this problem, my first patrol was dealyed until my costume was ready.


For Christmas, I got a new computer, some new video games, and a bunch of books. Same as every Christmas, except for the new computer. After getting a new computer, I realized that research is one thing that would be aided by my power. Time to research fluid dynamics!


ClickClackClickClackClickClackClick


Wow, WiFi is slow relative to my perception of time. Also, it turns out that fluid dynamics is far beyond my math level. That was a wasted five seconds.


ClickClackClickClackClickClackClick


Video games are slow too. Even 60 FPS for me is 1FPS. I was annoyed by this at first, but then realized I could easily multitask playing several video games at once. Also, my skill at first person shooters now far surpasses any other non-parahuman players. Of course, using that to win championships and stuff would be cheating, but it was still fun to mess around.


ClickClackClickClackClickClackClick


I'M A SUPERHERO! WHY AM I PLAYING VIDEO GAMES?


ClickClackClickClackClickClackClick


Okay, I'm researching sound, and speech, and stuff like that. To make realistic sounding voices with my water, which I decided to make my primary form of speech rather than my mouth. I used recordings of myself from before I got my power to figure out how to replicate my own voice.


ClickClackClickClackClickClackClick


Books are fun to read now! From anyone else's perspective, it would look like I was just flipping through. However, I was actually reading entire books in the matter of seconds! Haha!


FlipFlipFlipFlipFlipFlip


No! Bad Harriet! You should be researching!


ClickClackClickClackClickClackClick


Natural movement of the human body is useful to know. For both making my movement seem normal, and to make my human body water projection look normal. I'll probably send her out to go heroing once I'm done with this.


ClickClackClickClackClickClackClick


And my human body water projection is complete! I decided that she should be a seperate hero from Cetacean, so I decided to call her Hydrological. I sent out water around the city to listen for crime, since I wasn't super good at sensing shapes, and didn't want to mistake someone giving another person a hug for assualting them.


PewPewPewPewPewPewPew


Field of water ears has been assembled! It uses a bit of my limit, but being able to hear the entire city was very helpful. I tuned out certain places that seemed to not have very much crime, but listened to the rest.


A mugging! Haha! I'm going to save that person! Just materialize Hydrological right in between them and –


The mugger freaked out. I didn't even get to use my power! Seriously, if I just had the power to turn invisible that would have worked. Whatever. I had Hydrological say "Some nerve committing crime on Christmas. Didn't you know the ghost of Christmas would stop you?" He screamed. "Just kidding. I'm a new hero, Hydrological." Would it be suspicious having two water heroes pop up at the same time? Eh, probably not.


"Thank you for saving me!" The person I saved said. I realized that they were looking down. Right, Hydrological was only about a meter tall.


"No problem. Uh, can you call the police or something? This guy needs to get arrested. I don't exactly have a phone, given that I'm made of water." I said as I noticed the mugger trying to run away. I used some water to prevent him from moving.


I used my water to hear the phone conversation. She said her location first, and then said "Someone just tried to mug me!"


"Tried? What happened?"


"I was saved by a hero! She said she's new, and her name is Hydrological."


"You should have called the PRT about this if a parahuman was involved."


"It was just a mugging!"


"Okay. Where is the mugger now?"


"He's being pinned down by Hydrological."


"Okay. Tell her to keep him pinned down until we come, and then go to the PRT building to register as a hero." More signing! Ugh. I could say I was Cetacean, but randomly stopping muggings was probably not a good idea if I wanted to stay in the Wards.


"I heard." I said into the phone, to prevent having to hear the same thing twice. "Super hearing, and can throw my voice."


"Oh, if those are your powers, why are you called Hydrological?" Asked the police officer.


"My main power is that I'm made out of controllable water. Turns out, there's a lot of things you can do with that."


"Ah."


"I'll be my way onto the PRT building. My power doesn't have a range limit, so I'll keep the mugger pinned down."


"Okay, thanks."


I went to the PRT building, and went to tell them that I was a new hero and stuff. I was initially planning to just do the bare minimum for them to ignore me, but then I realized I could do some real good if I worked with the Protecterate. So I walked in at nearly my full size, and put my full focus into this.


"Hey, I'm the new Hero, Hydrological. I'd like to get some agreement to allow me to work with the Protecterate."


"Oh, you. Yeah, we've been hearing a lot about you." I had stopped 3 more muggings before I walked in. "We have a minimum staff right now, so could you come back on the 27th?" Right. The whole reason I had even created this identity. I hate Christmas.


"Right. Back to stopping crime!"


ShwooshShwooshSwooshShwooshShwooshSwooshSwoosh


I continued stopping crime at a very high speed for the next two days, while researching various things on my computer. I decided to stay out of the way of any parahumans, but otherwise I stopped pretty much every crime I saw.

# Chapter 3

I figured writing more of this is better than not writing at all, and I'm not really in the mood to write more of my other fanfiction, Banter, so I wrote another thousand words of this.


\-\-\-


Both me and Hydrological entered the PRT building as soon as it opened. Me, to get my costume and go on a patrol, and Hydrological to negotiate with the Protecterate. This would be a test of my ability to multitask on things that actually matter, not just playing multiple video games at once.


Right. I forgot. I have to actually talk to the PR people before I get my costume. And then I have to wait a few days. Ugh. School might start again before I actually get to patrol the city in my human body. Also, it turns out that a kids' dolphin costume is not something that the PRT PR want. Now both of my bodies are negotiating!


Speaking of negotiation, it turns out it's hard to negotiate if you're willing to give zero identifying information. Because of this, my only chance of getting Hydrological to work with the Protecterate was intimidation. Fortunately, I could do plenty of that.


My costume is fine I guess. Not the stupid idea I had came up with earlier, but it was fine. It consisted of a dark blue skirted one-piece swimsuit and a mask that looked like a dolphin's head. They justified the revealing outfit by saying that I would be likely to get wet due to my power, but by that logic every hero I worked with should wear a swimsuit too! Whatever. It was fine.


It turns out that demonstrating that I can instantly kill anything in the city with my power is a pretty good method of interrogation. I would be terrified of me if I weren't a pacifist. Also demonstrating my ability to monitor sounds throughout the city made the Protecterate want me to work with them, even without knowing anything about me.


SignSignSignSignSignSignSign


Now I'm a member of the Protecterate and Wards at the same time! I'm pretty sure this is illegal, but whatever. Now that I was done with that, I could make Hydrological's body small again and go back to stopping crime, like I had for the past two days.


Right, stopping crime. That's why I had decided to fight a literal fire-breathing dragon. That is a thing I'm doing now. As much as my power countered his, I did not want Lung to be the first parahuman I ever fought.


Pshhhhhhhhhhhhh


The sound of fire going out is cool! Also, it turns out that if all I do is keep Lung from moving or setting anything on fire, he'll slowly shrink back into a human. However, restraining Lung is difficult.


And there's Oni Lee. Restraining him would be literally impossible with just my power. I'll leave now, considering that I technically beat Lung, and I didn't want to be humiliated by losing to Oni Lee. This was breaking my 100% success rate at turning in criminals, but turning in Lung would cause way more problems than it would solve. I'll just use my power to prevent him from ever burning down buildings again.


So, Lung seemed like he would be a good person to practice fighting against if I don't use the tactic I used this time. Or, at least he'd be easier to practice against than basically every villain except Spitfire and Burnscar.


Right. Burnscar's in the Slaughterhouse 9. How would I deal with them? I mean, I could probably easily kill Jack Slash, Crawler, Bonesaw, Burnscar, Cherish, and Shatterbird. But that would leave Mannequin and Siberian rampaging around, as well as whatever Bonesaw put inher body to activate when she died.


Speaking of Bonesaw, how does a 12 year old get a kill order? Like seriously, if the Slaughterhouse 9 ever showed up in Brockton Bay, I would probably just kidnap Bonesaw and force her to go to therapist appointments until she stopped being evil. That was a thing I could do, right? I mean, it's definitely illegal, but I think it would be morally fine. Right?


Wait, what if Bonesaw wasn't actually evil, and was actually being forced to cooperate? That seems likely. Even in that case, she still needed a lot of therapy. So yeah, my plan for Bonesaw is kidnapping followed by therapy.


Also, I could easily take away Burnscar's power without killing her, just by sendinig my water to put out fires. Because of that, killing her wouldn't be necessary. However, Jack Slash, Crawler, and Shatterbird would still die the instant they entered the city, if they ever decided to. Oh, and Cherish I guess.


Wait, should I kill Cherish? She was their newest member, and I knew nothing about her. Maybe she was being forced to cooperate, like I suspected Bonesaw was. However, her power could be too dangerous to risk, like Shatterbird. I'd probably try to just nonlethally incapacitate her, and hand her in with the dead bodies of the rest.


With this plan, The Siberian and Mannequin would still be alive, but we could handle just those two fine. Maybe.


Well, if I'm coming up with plans for the Slaughterhouse 9, I should probably come up with Endbringer plans. Simurgh is easy, just use my power on the water in everyone's body to fling them out of her range. The other two might be a bit tricky.


Hmm…


Yeah, I'd be no better than anyone else if Leviathan or Behemoth came. I guess I could just fling all the civilians out of the city, but that wasn't a guarenteed win like my Simurgh and Slaughterhouse 9 plans.


I can't think of any other threats worth coming up with a plan for right now. The other S-Class threats, Sleeper and Ash Beast are on the other side of the planet, and are pretty slow moving. Oh right, I almost forgot about Nilbog. I guess I could just deal with him like I would deal with the Slaughterhouse 9? I would be surprised if he ever left Ellisburg though. So yeah, planning is done. Back to stopping crime until my costume is finished.

# Chapter 4

I like writing this story a lot. Even though it's probably a lot worse than my other story. Anyways, here's another chapter.

\-\-\-

Yay! My costume is done! And I'm going on a patrol as a Ward! I'll be faaamoouus!!!!


BlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlah


Why did I want to be famous again? Right, it gives me motivation. Also, it's fun. Also, I've been patrolling for an hour and haven't stopped any crime. Now might be the time to ask someone about that. Unfortunately, I was patrolling with Shadow Stalker, so this was unlikely to be a remotely fun conversation. "Hey, Shadow Stalker?"


"What?" She sounded annoyed just by the fact that I was talking to her.


"Why haven't we seen any crime to stop yet?"


"Oh." She seemed surprised that I would ask that. "It's because our city actually got a competent hero."


"Who?" Was she referring to me? I hadn't stopped that much crime, right?


"Hydrological. I don't like her methods, but she did succeed at getting rid of all the non-parahuman crime in this city in a week." I had noticed that there wasn't much crime that I was noticing, but I figured that was just because criminals had figured out how to be quiet while committing crime.


"I've heard of her. What don't you like about her methods?" I almost said "my methods". Thank Scion for my powers allowing me to think so fast.


"Too soft. The only reason it took her a full week was because she refused to use violence. Hell, she sometimes even let the criminals go free if they promised to not commit crime any more!" Aw come on. I did moniter them closely after they made that promise.


"I think that's a good thing, people deserve second chances."


"Hah. You're an idiot."


BlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlah


So, it turns out Shadow Stalker is insane. I wasn't exactly surprised, but seriously. Ranting for 5 whole minutes about how much you hate weak people? I had to resist the urge to call her out on every stupid thing she said. I couldn't have her deciding I was one of the weak ones, since being beat up is not something I wanted to deal with.


You know, she's probably beating up other people when the PRT isn't watching. I decided to get some of my water on her to monitor like the other criminals that I had let go free. The patrol fortunately finished without us talking again.


The day after my first patrol, school was starting up again. That was another reason I wanted to be famous! Since I won't have a secret identity, I get to brag to all my friends about my powers.


By all my friends, I meant my singular friend. Her name is Christine. I guess I have other friends now that I'm in the Wards, but the new Ward suddenly becoming friends with Chris and Dennis might be suspicous.


"So, Christine," I started. I wanted her to be the first one to hear. "You wanna know what happened over Christmas break?"


"You stepped on a sea urchin, so you had to leave early from your trip to Hawaii?"


"Well, that is related to the thing that I wanted to tell you." I opened my water bottle, and pulled the water into the shape of a small dolphin. "I got powers."


"You're Hydrological!?" She screamed. Ugh. Right. Cetacean was only known as the new minor Ward. When someone saw water powers, they would think of the hero who basically ended all crime in Brockton Bay, Hydrological.


"I'm Cetacean." I said. "See? Dolphin." At this point people were staring at us.


"Ah. I'm assuming you didn't intend to tell the entire school." She said, sounding embarassed.


"Nah. Secret identities are for people actually capable of lying, which is a group of people that doesn't include me." I didn't mention that my increased thought speed made it so I could hide the fact that I was lying.


"Huh. I guess that explains why your voice sounds weird too. People are saying that Cetacean had some minor power that made her voice sound weird." I had just told my best friend I was a superhero, and all she cared about was my voice? Maybe I should just say that I'm Hydrological. Wait, no, then everyone in the school would be terrified of me.


"I think faster to help me manage my water, so I have to make an effort to talk slowly so people can understand me."


"Faster thinking!? You can think faster than normal people, but you tell everyone that you just have 'minor hydrokinesis'?"


"Uh, yeah? What use is faster thinking in fights?" I quickly realized the stupidity of my question. "Oh. Right."


"Exactly! It isn't like you're fighting at all, considering that Hydrological wiped out all crime in the city."


I was about to mention that I left the ABB and E88 mostly alone due to them having capes, but then I realized that would imply that I knew more about Hydrological than I was supposed to. Keeping secrets is hard. "Yeah. But you know what I can use my powers for?" I shaped the dolphin I had made into a little duck. "Making tiny things!"


I showed the school my powers, making tiny shapes out of water on request. This was fun. I'm remembering why I wanted to be famous. At some point, I changed into my costume so that people would recognize me more as Cetacean than Harriet.


While this was going on, the water I left on Shadow Stalker had overheard her bullying some kid named Taylor Hebert. It didn't seem like too much for now, but it had only been a few hours. I decided to keep a watch on her just in case she did anything to bad.


Speaking of Shadow Stalker doing anything to bad to Taylor, the next day, she had filled her locker with grossness! I couldn't just clean out the locker, as that would just end up with a bunch of grossness on the floor.


Then, Shadow Stalker grabbed Taylor, and began pushing her in. This was very bad. She would die! No no no no no! I can't let a Ward murder someone! I quickly grabbed a bunch of water from Shadow Stalker's water bottle, as well as water that was in the grossness in the locker, and put up a wall of water pushing Taylor out.


Since there was no more denying that I was here, I materialized Hydrological. "I never thought that one of the times I had to stop attempted murder would be in a school! I mean seriously –" Shadow Stalker punched my small floating body, messing up the vibrations that were allowing me to speak.


After I rematerialized, I started talking again. "Punching a hero? Really? I thought the only people who did that were villains! Oh, and idiots." And she punched me again.


"Okay, so you're both." I checked around for kids with phones. Apparently Taylor didn't have one. It was probably stolen by Shadow Stalker. I pointed to one kid with a phone. "You! Call the police! Or maybe the PRT?"


"I'm not an idiot!" Shadow Stalker said as soon as she processed my earlier statement. Apparently she was fine being called a villain.


"Yeah, I'll leave this body here as a punching bag for the idiot. I can have my voice come from other places too."


I noticed that the kid had called the police, and then remembered that I was in a school. Where rules were supposed to be enforced. I had my water disperse throughout the school. "Hey! There was just an attempted murder here! Also the attempted murderer is using me as a punching bag!" Shadow Stalker was also texting on her phone. I couldn't see who she was texting, or what she was texting them, but I'm pretty sure they'd trust me over her.


Shadow Stalker realized that she should have run when the police showed up. She proceeded to run away. I remembered her rant from two days ago. "Running away like prey? Really?" I then created a wall of water to prevent her from escaping. She started swearing, and as somebody began shooting containment foam, she went into her Shadow State.


Well, there goes her secret identity. Also, there goes Taylor's sanity, if her expression is anything to go by. I couldn't exactly prevent her from escaping, but I figured she wouldn't show herself again at this school, or maybe even in this city! Sure, somewhere there would be a new villain or something, but at least she wasn't a Ward getting away with relentlessly bullying this poor girl.


Speaking of Taylor, I needed to make sure she was okay. I put a drop of water near her ear, and quietly said in a voice only she could hear "Are you okay? How long has she been doing this?"


"2 years." She mumbled after looking around a bit. "She's been working with Emma and Madison too, but I doubt they'll try anything with you around."


"And are you okay?"


"No."


"Uh, how could I help?" I'm sure this girl wasn't the person in the city who was suffering the most, but I figured one less person suffering is always good.


"You couldn't."


Great. I had to figure out her problem myself. "I'll stop the bullies."


"I still wouldn't have any friends, and I'd still have to lie to my dad." She was lying to her dad about being bullied?


"You've been lying to your dad for two years!?"


"Yeah. I didn't want him to get worried."


I realized that wasn't the problem. The problem was that she didn't have any friends, didn't have a support network. "Uh, and about not having any friends, I could be your friend."


"Ah yes, the hero who got rid of all crime in Brockton Bay within a week being friends with.. well… me."


"Yeah! Why not? Plus, you seem pretty good at keeping secrets." I said as I remembered that I didn't have anyone to tell about being both Cetacean and Hydrological


"Why does that matter?"


"I have a secret that I haven't told anyone, and having a friend to tell it to would be nice." My parents would be too worried and Christine would just tell everyone, so I didn't have anyone to tell.


"But you don't know me!"


"We can get to know each other. I can be a reassuring voice in your ear to help you, and you can talk to me if you need someone to talk to."


"Okay." Taylor got up, picked up her backpack, and went off to continue school.

# Chapter 5

A chapter in which I try to make Cetacean less of a Mary Sue.


--


So, Taylor's actually pretty similar to me. She's smart, nerdy, and introverted. So, she'll probably be a good friend. By the end of the week, she was a lot more trusting of the idea that I would be friends with her. Apparently her previous best friend is actually one of the bullies that have been tormenting her.


Well, anyways, I told her to meet me in some alley today so I could tell her my secret, and so she could actually meet me. When she showed up, she said exactly what I had expected her to. "Uh, why are you here? I was told to meet –"


"This is my secret." I said in Hydrological's voice as I materialized Hydrological next to me. "I figured you were pretty good at keeping them, considering that you kept your bullying secret from your dad for 2 years."


"Wait, what are you saying? That you two are siblings?"


"No." I said with both of my bodies. "We're the same person."


"Hydrological is a projection!?"


"Yup!" I said as I dematerialized Hydrological.


"So, your power is long range high precision hydrokinesis?"


"That, and the ability to think sixty times faster than normal."


"That sounds… traumatizing. That means that since you met me, you've experienced time worth nearly a year!"


"Yeah, it was kinda boring at first. But I'm managing to get rid of that boredom by being Hydrological."


"Wait, so Hydrological only exists because you got bored?"


"Well, sorta. I triggered, er, got my powers during the short vacation that the people at PRT who make costumes got. So since they wouldn't let me patrol until I got my costume, I decided to do what I intended to do already, but as a different identity, which I called Hydrological."


"Ah. So you still would have done the same things, just under the identity of Cetacean. But if that were it, then you wouldn't be so worried about keeping it secret."


"Yeah, I kinda realized that the PRT might not like a Ward doing the things that I do. But clearly they were fine with Shadow Stalker, so I don't know."


"Don't remind me of that."


"Sorry. I hated her guts too, if it makes you feel any better."


"It doesn't really."


"Ah. Okay." There was a bit of a silence. "Uh, the other reason I called you here, is because I want to take you on as my sidekick!"


"What? But I don't have any powers!"


"So what? You're smart, and you're the only one who knows my secret. Plus, you survived two years of, well, that."


"You really think I could become your sidekick?"


"Yeah! And if you didn't, I would have gotten all this equipment for nothing." I revealed a mask, a baton, a tranquilizer gun, and various other things that would be useful for a hero to have. I figured I could have waited until after she agreed to get the stuff, but it was more dramatic this way.


She stared at the equipment in awe. "Wow."


"And if you want, you can go on your first patrol now."


"What? Patrol?"


"With my water, I can't see. I can feel and hear, but sight is often useful. While I could patrol for myself, I'm pretty much the worst person to accidentally get in a fight. You seemed to be pretty good at handling stuff, even if you could use a bit of training."


"Uh, sure. It isn't like I have anything better to be doing, and I used to want to be a hero, though I always imagined doing it with powers."


"You'll do great! Also, remember that if you get in trouble, I will prevent you from getting hurt."


"Okay." She got on her belt, and put her equipment on it, and went off.


I decided to lead her to various suspicious locations that I had found, but most of them had turned out to be nothing. Honestly, that's what I was expecting, but it was nice to check. After that, came the real reason I had started this patrol. It was… a test.


See, I needed to see how she would react to bad situations. I went over to the street where I had set up for the test to occur, and hid in a nearby alley so I could watch. I told her about a suspicious location that would require her walking through this street to get there.


Now, the reason I had chosen this street is because I convinced Lung to go this way. Fighting Lung is a bad situation, so this will be a great test, especially considering the fact that there's basically no way for her to get hurt against Lung with me helping her. Worst case scenario, she trusts me a bit less.


Lung is there, getting bigger and bigger, and now he's a dragon. Great, now Taylor should show up right about now.


There she is! And she's freezing. Of course she's freezing. That's the worst thing she could do in this test. Running away would be fine, fighting would be fine, but freezing? There is basically no situation where freezing is the right idea.


Wait no, she's not freezing. She's pulling out the pepper spray? What? That'll just make Lung angrier and make everything worse! Ugh. She isn't even talking to me!


Now Lung is angrier! Wonderful! And now she's hitting him with a baton. Why? What is –


I woke up. Apparently I had passed out. And looking at the battlefield, so had Taylor and Lung. Well, now they were both getting up. What had happened? Lung is getting smaller, which might just be a side affect of –


Taylor's getting bigger? It's like she took Lung's power.


Oh.


I'm a terrible person and an idiot. I just made her trigger.


So, it turns out this is the worst case scenario. Taylor getting a power. And not just any power, but a Trump power. I continued watching to figure out the details.


Taylor kept growing, and Lung kept shrinking. They were both confused. Eventually they reached a point where they were both equal in size, and stopped. This… is interesting.


Wait no, this is my fault I caused my friend so much trauma that she got powers this is very very bad.


But because of my stupidity, I can now watch two dragons fight!


Wait no, she's my friend I shouldn't make her fight Lung.


There. I sent water to restrain Lung. Now everything is fine. Perfectly fine. Nothing wrong at all. "Uh, sorry about that." I said to Taylor. Using my real body. Which was 20 feet away from her. And she was a very angry dragon. "Please don't hurt me!"


I noticed Taylor was becoming more human after she walked away from Lung. She looked very angry, so that meant her power stealing was range based, so that's good for not being overpowered. On the other hand, for every step she took toward me I had a chance of losing my advantage, which was my increased thinking speed. "What just happened!?" Taylor screamed.


I put a water wall right in front of me. "Don't get any closer! This is all my fault! I'm stupid! I'm a terrible friend! And a terrible person! And –"


She stopped. "You… caused… that!?" She pointed at Lung.


"Uh, sorta?"


"Why!? How!?"


"I just annoyed Lung into coming this way…"


"Why would you do that!?"


"I figured it would be a safe test to see what you would do in a bad situation."


"On my first day of being your sidekick!?"


"I know! I know! I'm stupid!" Turns out, thinking faster makes panic worse, not better. So maybe it would be helpful if she got closer. I put down the water wall.


"Well, now I have powers. And I battled Lung."


"Well, you came out unharmed. And powers are a good thing! Your powers seem… pretty cool."


"That doesn't change the fact that you were an idiot for thinking that would be a good idea."


"I know!"


"Maybe I shouldn't work with you. I mean, we can still be friends, but if you're going to come up with plans like this…"


"You're right. You can keep the stuff I got you. Think of it as an apology gift?"


"Sure." She began to walk away.


"Wait! I want to test your powers!"


"Last time you tested anything, it ended like this."


"Right." I watched as she walked away.

# Chapter 6

So, Taylor's gonna be an independent hero now. She'll fight parahumans, which actually makes more sense for her, given the power that I caused her to end up with. I suggested that she name herself Distribution, given that her power distributes nearby powers between herself and the owner of the power. She reluctantly accepted, but only because she couldn't come up with her own name.


I guess the fact that she's only fighting parahumans while I'm only fighting non-parahumans is nice. Even though she hates me now, she's still helping me make Brockton Bay a better city!


So, I need a new sidekick. The only problem with that is that everyone I know would either not want to be my sidekick or not be able to keep my secret. I suppose I can just go public about Hydrological and Cetacean being the same person…


Hmm…


What would happen in that situation? Well, the PRT would give me more restrictions, and criminals might come after me at school or at home, since my civilian identity as Cetacean is public. Yeah, there's no way I'm going to do that.


You know, I can go without a sidekick for a bit. I'd do fine alone.


Wait, I haven't stopped a crime in over an hour! That means I could use my water for other purposes! Like searching places! I could be my own sidekick!


So it turns out most buildings are boring. I guess I now know the locations of every basement in the city, but that's not much. There were a few buildings that could have been Empire hideouts, but I was afraid that if they weren't, my reputation would be ruined by materializing there.


Ooh, a big basement. This had potential to be important. Yeah. This basement was way too big to be legal. I think. I should ask the PRT.


BlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlah


Actually, the basement was fine. Or at least, it wasn't something that I should look into. "Thanks Tom!"


"Don't call me Tom." The man who had helped me was getting increasingly annoyed with me.


"Okay Tommy!" I decide to have some fun. He already thinks I’m annoying, so it couldn't hurt to confirm it!


"My name is Thomas!"


"Oh, like Thomas the Tank Engine?" My cousin really liked that show when he was little.


Thomas seems at a loss for words, until he says "Yes."


"Okay, Tommy the Train." I decide to go for one last bit of annoyance. "I'm supposed to go investigate the basement now, right?"


I knew he would be angry, but not this angry. If anything bad happened here, it would be my fault. I didn't think he would do anything bad. He just yelled "No!" and stormed off.


Should I actually investigate it just to annoy him?


Nah. I have better things to do, such as looking for more suspicious basements.


Over the next few minutes I find a few more basements that are suspicious. A few of them are filled with dogs, and I’m sure enough that it’s a dog fighting ring that I free the dogs, leaving them for someone else to deal with. A few are also obviously illegal prisons or something like that, so I free the people in those too.


Once I finish freeing everyone, I go back to my normal schedule of monitoring alleys and stopping any criminals I see.


Nothing notable happens after that, until a few days later, when a blonde girl with freckles walks up to me near the end of school. Then, she whispers, "Before you ask, I know all your secrets."


"I don't have any secrets," I say. My face does weird things as I say it, but I figure my face does weird things often enough that she might not notice.


"You're a terrible liar. Anyways, I'm not here to blackmail you. I just wanted to warn you that Coil is after you."


"Who's Coil?" I know who he is, but I have an old habit of asking questions for clarification in ways that can be misinterpreted as not knowing something.


"The villain who employs a bunch of mercenaries, including the Undersiders." That’ss new information. "He's also the one that you found the base of a few days ago."


"Yeah, I told the PRT. They'll figure it out."


She facepalmed. "That guy you told? He's Coil's civilian identity."


"Wow, with all this information, you would be a very useful sidekick."


"Problem is, I'm already being forced to work with Coil at gunpoint. I'm the villain Tattletale."


"Ah. I'm assuming you want him gone?"


"Yup!" she says, no longer whispering. She walks away.


Well, now I need to investigate that base again. I don't completely trust that girl, but it’s not like having more information can hurt anyone.


As I walk home, I send a lot of my water back into the basement I found earlier. I find a large number of people, who are likely mercenaries. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it iss Coil's base, and I rather not randomly break into this place. Maybe that girl was trying to get me to assault some secret Protectorate base!


I can't really find anything really incriminating in here, other than it being really big. Since randomly appearing in here would probably make the Protectorate angry if it was theirs, I think that just asking Piggot would be the best option.


"Hey Piggot!" I say, materializing in her office.


"You can't just appear in my office!" she yells. Annoying people in high ranks of the PRT is fun!


"So, do you happen to have a giant underground base in Brockton Bay?"


"If we did, you wouldn't be allowed to know."


"Okay, then I'm flooding the giant basement I found, since someone said it was a supervillain's base. I'll evacuate everyone first, of course."


Piggot stares at me, speechless. I begin preparing to flood Coil’s base, and start grabbing the people near the top to send to the PRT.


"Uh, you guys do have room for a few dozen people here, right?" I ask, realizing how many people I will be dropping off. "No idea how many of these guys are parahuman, or which is Coil, so I'm just throwing them all here."


I stop what I am doing as soon as Piggot calls security or whatever. "No, wait! You have no way to imprison me!" Why did I say that of all things? I don't want to seem power crazy, but that just makes me seem power crazy.


Okay, I need to come up with a plan. Currently, the PRT thinks I've gone mad with power, Coil probably knows that I know where his secret base is, and none of these things are actually threats to my life now that I think about it. Okay, no need to panic.


I decide that intimidation is generally the best way to go in situations that are this bad. I bring a lot of water into the basement that I just realized is not guaranteed to be Coil's base. Crap. Uh, I'll just ask everyone in the base if it's Coil's? Worth a shot.


I put a bit of water in the ear of each person in the base, and whisper "Hey, is this Coil's base? Like, the supervillain Coil?"


The response is varied, but if I’m actually somewhere other than Coil's base, I won't have gotten five or so answers of "yes". Okay. Now I'm certain that I should be messing with this base. Now I need to find Coil, and get rid of him.


"Hey, Piggot, do you know where Tommy is?" I ask. I’m pretty sure that what Tattletale told me is true, since the part about it being Coil's base is true.


I then remember that she is in the process of calling security on me. Probably not a good source of information. I evaporate the body in her office.


Okay, I can't read name tags through my water. This is a major problem. I give another ridiculous plan a try, and put water in the ears of everyone in the PHQ and Coil's base, and whisper, "Are you either Thomas Calvert, or Coil? If so, tell me which." I add that last part to make it seem like I don't know they are the same person.


The only yes I get is from Clockblocker, who says he's Coil. I ignore him, since if he somehow managed to live as Dennis, Clockblocker, Thomas Calvert, and Coil all at once, I doubt I can take him on. So, I’m counting that as not a possibility.


Okay, another ridiculous plan. If I just do enough ridiculous plans, one is bound to succeed, right? No. That isn't how it works. Maybe I should just calm down. There is no threat to my life. Sure, everyone will be confused, but who cares if everyone is confused? I'm in a really bad situation right now, and if I wait, I can be in a better situation.


I suddenly return all my water to its normal position, and continue my day as if nothing happened.

Author's Note: Sorry I haven't done anything for so long. When I started writing Worm fanfiction, I was on arc 25, and writing fanficition without finishing it felt irresponsible. I decided to slow down my writing a lot to make it so I could finish it. I'm now on arc 30, so I'll start updating more later. I'm also going to make a website to put my original stories soon probably.
