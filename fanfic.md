# Fanfiction

I occasionally write fanfiction. It isn't my best writing, but I figure I should get all my writing in one place, you know?

# Worm

All the fanfiction I've written has been for [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/), which is a story about superpowers. Now, I have moved on to writing original stories, so none of these fanfictions will be continued. All of these stories do contain spoilers for Worm, so read at your own risk!

[Banter](/fanfic/banter.html): A fanfiction of Worm where Taylor gets a slightly different power, and then things snowball out of control due to a couple incredibly powerful powers. I gave up on writing this one because I hadn't read all of Worm when I started it, and accidentally gave people powers that existed in canon.

[Cetacean](/fanfic/cetacean.html): A fanfiction of Worm where I add my own character based roughly on me with a pair of overpowered powers. I kind of wrote this one for fun, so once I got to the point where I had to put effort into it, I decided to give up since it wasn't very good in the first place.

[Full Vial](/fanfic/full-vial.html): A fanfiction of Worm where I make a character who suffered too much suffer a bit less. I gave up on this one because I'm not good enough at writing fanfiction to give this idea the effort it deserves.


[Partition](/fanfic/partition.html): A fanfiction of Worm where Taylor gets a different power, and then I stopped after one chapter because I decided to put all my focus on original work. However, if I do decide to continue writing any fanfiction, it'll be this one, since I came up with several ideas that I really liked for it.
